# Question
**Maraviroc** is a(n) **CCR5** inhibitor that inhibits HIV entrance into macrophages early in the disease course

# Answer
Budding of the virus from the cell membrane = final step in the release of newly synthesized HIV virions. Proteases are involved in the final packaging and release of virions, and protease inhibitors prevent successful completion of these steps.    CCR5 is still found on CD4+ T-cells and used as entry (however CXCR4 according to FC is major entry)
