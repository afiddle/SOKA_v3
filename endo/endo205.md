# Question
What is the likely diagnosis in a patient with weight loss, tachycardia, anti-thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies, and the physical exam findings below?   Thyroid gland: normal size, non-tender TSH: low Free T4: high Radioactive iodine uptake: < 5%    **Painless (silent) thyroiditis**

# Answer
painless thyroiditis is often a self-limited hyperthyroid phase of Hashimoto thyroiditis (both have TPO); RAIU is decreased due to preformed thyroid hormone.
