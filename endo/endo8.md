# Question
The **T3 resin uptake** test may be used to indirectly assess circulating levels of **TBG**

---

# Answer
"radioactive T3 will first bind to unoccupied sites on the patients TBG; ""leftover"" radioactive T3 will bind to the resin   thyroid hormone levels (ie, thyroxine [T4], triiodothyronine [T3])   thyroglobulin = released from thyroid follicles with thyroid hormone   radioactive iodine uptake (ie, radioiodine thyroid scintigraphy) = thyroid metabolic activity and organification of iodine due TSH stimulation     high thyroid hormone levels = T4, T3 == elevated thyroglobulin   loss of TSH stimulation? decreased metabolic activity from thyroid = less radioactive iodine uptake"
