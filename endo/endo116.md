# Question
Effect of diabetes on hepatic glycolysis: no answer **:)**       - No PFK-2 (=phosphofructokinase-2) ~lack of insulin    - No glucose trapping *liver* == elevated blood glucose = hyperglycemia

# Answer
Insulin lowers plasma glucose ~inc glucose uptake *fat, muscle, and liver* Insulin == inc in glycolysis ~actv of PFK2, the enzyme that produces fructose 2,6-bisphosphate  High intracellular [fructose 2,6-bisphosphate] = major regulator of PFK1 (=phosphofructokinase-1), which catalyzes the rate-limiting step in glycolysis (by converting fructose 6-phosphate to fructose 1,6-bisphosphate)  As a result, the rise in fructose 2,6-bisphosphate lvls CAUSED BY INSULIN == inc in glycolysis & inhibition of gluconeogenesis == hypoglycemia
