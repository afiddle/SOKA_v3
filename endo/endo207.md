# Question
What is the likely diagnosis in a young patient with hypertension that develops severe hypokalemia after starting a low-dose thiazide diuretic (e.g. muscle weakness, leg cramps)?   **Primary hyperaldosteronism**

# Answer
- patients with mild primary hyperaldosteronism are prone to developing diuretic-induced hypokalemia; makes sense because volume depletion → ↑ aldosterone → more Na in, H/K out; other findings include metabolic alkalosis and mild hypernatremia - next steps: check aldosterone:renin ratio → CT scan to check bilateral hyperplasia (aldosterone antagonists) vs. single aldosterone-secreting adenoma (cut it out)
