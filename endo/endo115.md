# Question
Increased glucagon (fasting) leads to increased cAMP and protein kinase A, thus **increasing** activity of FBPase-2 and **decreasing** activity of PFK-2

# Answer
FBPase-2 = fructose bisphosphatase-2   glucagon & epinephrine == inc glycogenolysis *liver; liver, mm, respectively* & inc gluconeogenesis = cAMP/Adenylate cyclase   Whereas, insulin == inc glucose uptake *liver, mm, fat* & inc glycogen synthesis *liver, mm*, and dec gluconeogenesis = IP3 / Phosphoinositide 3-kinase
