# Question
"The **N-terminal signal peptide** of preproinsulin is cleaved *RER* while the peptide chains are being assembled, yielding **proinsulin** later transported to Golgi for ""the final cleavage"""

---

# Answer
"- DNA to insulin mRNA, initiation of translation - Translocation of preproinsulin to RER (ie, rough ER) == N-terminal peptide is cleaved, converting preproinsulin to proinsulin, which are transported to Golgi and packed into granules - Proinsulin have their ""connecting peptide"" cleaved by beta cell peptidases == insulin 'n' free C-peptide, stored in granules 'til secretion"
