# Question
In the circulation, most of the T3 and T4 is bound to **thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG)**

# Answer
only free thyroid hormones are active, thus TBG provides a large reservoir of circulating thyroid hormones that can be added to the pool of free thyroid hormone   normal TSH & free T4 with low total T4    there's a binding-problem   FREE = ACTIVE = UNBOUND    thyroxine-binding globulin TBG deficiency    benign, X-linked & euthyroid   total = bound + unbound ttl = inactive + active ttl = trapped/used + free
