# Question
What is the rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis?   **Phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1)**

---

# Answer
Insulin == increase in glycolysis by activating phosphofructokinase-2 (PFK2), the enzyme that produces fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. - The intracellular [] fructose 2,6-bisphosphate is the major regulator of PFK1, which converts fructose 6-phosphate to fructose 1,6-bisphosphate in the rate-limiting step of glycolysis  - Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate stimulates PFK1 while inhibiting the reverse enzyme, fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase - As a result, the rise in fructose 2,6-bisphosphate lvls caused by insulin == increase in glycolysis 'n' inhibition of gluconeogenesis == hypoglycemia
