# Question
While being packed into secretory granules within pancreatic beta cells, proteases cleave the **C-peptide::connecting peptide** of proinsulin, yielding **insulin** 'n' free **C-peptide**

# Answer
"- DNA to insulin mRNA, initiation of translation - Translocation of preproinsulin to RER (ie, rough ER) == N-terminal peptide is cleaved, converting preproinsulin to proinsulin, which are transported to Golgi and packed into granules - Proinsulin have their ""connecting peptide"" cleaved by beta cell peptidases == insulin 'n' free C-peptide, stored in granules 'til secretion"
