# Question
Thyroid nodules may be studied using **131I** radioactive uptake studies

---

# Answer
thyroid hormone levels (ie, thyroxine [T4], triiodothyronine [T3])   thyroglobulin = released from thyroid follicles with thyroid hormone   radioactive iodine uptake (ie, radioiodine thyroid scintigraphy) = thyroid metabolic activity and organification of iodine due TSH stimulation     high thyroid hormone levels = T4, T3 == elevated thyroglobulin   loss of TSH stimulation? decreased metabolic activity from thyroid = less radioactive iodine uptake
