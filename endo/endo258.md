# Question
Fasting state defense hormones to maintain normoglycemia:     1. glucagon = acutely in falling glucose lvls; stimulates glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis 2. **epinephrine** = concurrently; also stimulates glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, limiting glucose utilization by some peripheral tissues   3. **cortisol & GH::2** = continued fasting; they alter transcription of key enzymes   - **cortisol** increases transcription of gluconeogenic enzymes and of lipolysis and proteolysis. Depends on intracellular receptors   - **GH** antagonizes insulin action, increases gluconeogenesis, and promotes lipolysis (provides gluconeogenic substrates). Acts via extracellular, transmembrane receptor, activating JAK-STAT pathway
