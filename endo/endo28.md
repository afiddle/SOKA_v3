# Question
Which three antibodies are associated with Hashimoto thyroiditis?    **Anti-thyroglobulin**, **anti-microsomal**, and **anti-thyroid peroxidase**

# Answer
these are a sign of thyroid damage, not the cause of damage - anti-TPO thyroid peroxidase == thyroglobulin iodination; + in 90% of pts w/ chronic lymphocytic (Hashimoto) thyroiditis
