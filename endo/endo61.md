# Answer
cortisol and glucocorticoids = significant anti-inflammatory effect = by decreasing production of prostaglandins and leukotrienes, derived from arachidonic acid.   The binding of cortisol or other steroids to the glucocorticoid receptor == increased annexin A1 production, inhibiting phospholipase A2  Phospholipase A2 = production of arachidonic acid through cleavage of phospholipides  Thus, cortisol and other glucocorticoids are anti-inflammatory; they decrease synthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes by == arachidonic acid deprivation
