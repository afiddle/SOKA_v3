---

# Answer
= isolated bone lesions or diffuse, multisystemic, invasive disease;  - Proliferation of Langerhans cells and histiocytes (activated dendritic cells and macrophages), and eosinophils *H&E* - Cytologic markers = CD1, CD1a, and S-100 - Birbeck granules *EM*   T lymphocyte activation by dendritic APC, like a Langerhans cell *skin*, requires two signals: - binding of MHC II with the TLR, and the - binding of B7 w/ CD28  Requiring both signals decreases: - activ of T lymphs to self-antigens, and the - incidence of autoimmunity
