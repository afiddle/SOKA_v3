# Answer
type III HSR (immune complexes deposit in skin, joints or vessels == activate classical complement == neutrophils from the mononuclear phagocyte system == vasculitis and fibrinoid necrosis)    1-2w post-exposure to antitoxins (eg, antivenom), monoclonal Ab, or vaccines (eg, rabies antigens); why? Time lag between antigen processing, presentation, CD4 T-lymphocyte activation, and T-cell-mediated B-cell activation/differentiation
