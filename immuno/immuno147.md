# Question
"What is the likely diagnosis in a patient with elbow pain that worsens with resisted wrist extension and wrist passive flexion?    **Lateral epicondylitis (""tennis elbow"")**"

---

# Answer
due to non-inflammatory angiofibroblastic tendinosis at the common extensor origin (think of a backhand tennis shot = going to the lateral side)
