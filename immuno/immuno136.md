# Question
IFN-y is important for activating the **respiratory burst** in phagocytes

---

# Answer
The respiratory burst is important because it allows phagocytes the ability to kill ingested microbes  Steps 1 & 2 are the Respiratory Burst, step 3 converts the product to HClO- (the most potent antibacterial - H2O2 is still antibacterial), this distinguishes CGD from a Myeloperoxidase Deficiency (nitro blue tetrazolium test)
