# Question

# Answer
T lymphocyte activation by a dendritic APC, like a Langerhans cell in the skin, requires 2 signals: - binding of MHC II w/ the TLR and - binding of B7 w CD28  The requirement of both signals decreases the activation of T lymphocytes to self-antigens and decreases the incidence of autoimmunity
