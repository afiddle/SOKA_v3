# Question
Interstitial restrictive lung disease may be caused by **pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis** (Eosinophilic granuloma)

---

# Answer
= isolated bone lesions or diffuse, multisystemic, invasive disease;  - Proliferation of Langerhans cells and histiocytes (activated dendritic cells and macrophages), and eosinophils *H&E* - Cytologic markers = CD1, CD1a, and S-100 - Birbeck granules *EM*   T lymphocyte activation by dendritic APC (eg, Langerhans cell *skin*) requires two signals binding: - MHC II w/ TLR, and the - B7 w/ CD28 == Decreasing activation of T lymphs to self-antigens, and  == Decreasing incidence of autoimmunity
