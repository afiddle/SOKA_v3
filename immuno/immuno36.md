# Question
Where does negative selection of T cells occur?    **Thymic medulla**

Negative selection is essential = eliminates T cells that bind to self MHC or self antigens. It occurs as a process of T cell maturation *thymic medulla*  Makes sense... if the inflammatory and immune gladiators weren't eliminated == self attack x self antigens == autoimmune disz
