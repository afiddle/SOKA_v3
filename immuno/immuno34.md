# Question
Which type of selection causes apoptosis of T cells expressing TCRs (ie, T-cell receptors) with high affinity for self antigens on thymic medullary epithelial and dendritic cells as a process of T cell maturation?    **Negative selection**

# Answer
these antigens are tissue-restricted self-antigens    Negative selection is essential = eliminates T cells that bind to self MHC or self antigens. It occurs as a process of T cell maturation *thymic medulla*  Makes sense... if the inflammatory and immune gladiators weren't eliminated == self attack x self antigens == autoimmune disz
