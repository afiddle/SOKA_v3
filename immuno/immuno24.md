# Question
The antigen receptors of **B** lymphocytes have a **hinge** region, which allows for flexibility

# Answer
Fab fragments with hinge regions = better able to reach multiple epitopes on an antigen;   This increases immunoglobulin avidity b/c avidity is directly proportional to the number of Fab-antigen interactions.    However, long hinge regions are more susceptible to destruction by bacterial proteases (eg, IgA protease).
