# Question
Which MHC class is associated with the gene products of HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C?    **MHC I**

---

# Answer
"""MHC 1 loci have 1 letter""   - We inherit 2 HLA haplotypes = one from each parent; Thus, siblings have 1/4 chance of identical matches = chance of identical 100% HLA genes is 1/4 + 1/2 of inheriting 50% same + 1/4 of inheriting none of the same"
