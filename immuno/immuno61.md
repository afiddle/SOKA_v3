# Question
The extrinsic (death receptor) pathway of apoptosis can occur via receptor binding between **Fas-L** or **TNF-Î±** and their respective receptors

---

# Answer
Fas receptor = expressed on T-lymphocytes = important role in the pathogenesis of cancer and autoimmune disorders    - Fas receptors = initiate the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis by its death domain. - Fas binding to Fas ligand (FasL) == Fas-associated death domain (FADD) - Receptor-bound FADD = activation of initiator caspases (8 & 10) == activation cascade == executioner caspases (3 & 6) == initiate processes of apoptosis  In the constant presence of stimulating self-antigens, activated T lymphocytes undergo apoptosis aka activation-induced cell death.   Mutations of Fas or FasL can prevent apoptosis of these lymphocytes == excessive accumulation of autoreactive T-cells == increasing the risk of autoimmune disorders (eg, SLE)
