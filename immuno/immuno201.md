# Question
GVHD of the liver presents with similar histologic findings (ie, dense, mononuclear lymphocytic infiltrate) to what immune disorder?   **Primary biliary cholangitis**

---

# Answer
"Primary biliary cholangitis = positive Antimitochondrial Ab = lymphocytic infiltrates and destruction of small and midsized intrahepatic bile ducts on bx   ""illegal immigrants invaded and attacked locals"" = GVHD dx = fever, rash, and hepatitis following liver transplantation  Another cause of Vanishing Bile Duct Syndrome; both show lymphocytic inflammation with destruction of the small intrahepatic bile ducts; granulomas and bile staining of hepatocytes are common findings; both have rise in ALP"
