# Question
NF-kB (ie, a transcription factor with a critical role in the immune response to infection) activation pathway: Pattern-Recognition Receptors recognize PAMPs which leads to activation of **IKB** kinase

---

# Answer
- PAMPs = pathogen-associated molecular patterns (eg, LPS being recognized by TLR4)   - Growth factors and mitogens, along with inflammatory cytokines (eg, TNFa binding to TNFR) will also signal through this mechanism
