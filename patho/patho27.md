# Question
Membranous nephropathy is characterized by diffuse capillary and **GBM** **thickening** on light microscopy

# Answer
diffuse capillary and GBM thickening = light microscopy ~ immune complex deposition, inflammation, mesangial cell activation, & matrix accumulation  While podocyte injury is a key underlying process in MN, the direct podocyte alterations = electron microscopy
