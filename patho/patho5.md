# Question
**Hydronephrosis** with **post-renal failure** is a common cause of death in advanced **cervical** carcinoma in females

---

# Answer
invasive cervical carcinoma tends to locally create symptoms, rather than metastasize to a different site     - Ureteral obstruction 'n' vesicoureteral reflux are common congenital urinary tract complications.   - Chronic reflux == hydroureter and hydronephrosis = dilation of the renal pelvis and calyces == compression atrophy of the renal parenchyma and eventual renal insufficiency and failure    - Hydronephrosis can be graded in severity; most severe = compress the parenchyma == gross distortion of renal architecture.
