# Question
Histologic findings of **IPF idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis** include:   - patchy dense collagen fibrosis in the interstitium,  - focal fibroblastic proliferation,  - honeycombing, and  - mild lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates with hyperplasia of type 2 pneumocytes.     * Bonus: Can you summarize its findings on LM and gross pathology?

# Answer
ILD Interstitial lung disease = progressive dyspnea, dry cough, digital clubbing, and crackles on examination. Tx of IPF = slowing progression of fibrosis by inhibiting TGF-beta transforming growth factor, and other fibrogenic growth factors (eg, PDGF, fibroblastic growth factor, and VEGF).
