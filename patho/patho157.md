# Question
"**Malignant::Type of** nephrosclerosis, a hypertensive emergency-related finding, has 2 patterns:   **Fibrinoid::type** necrosis: Cell death and excessive **fibrin** deposition within *small arteriolar walls*; circumferential, amorphous, pink material with smudged, necrotic endothelial cells, lacking cytologic detail    **Hyperplastic::type** arteriolosclerosis: Over time, activated PLTs and injured endothelial cells release growth factors, which induce concentric **hyperplasia** and **layering** of smooth mm cells and collagen == intimal thickening and ""onion-skin"" appearance   * Bonus: What is the difference bw the malignant (HTN emergency) and the hypertensive nephrosclerosis (chronic HTN)?"

# Answer
Hyperplastic arteriolosclerosis: Narrowing and/or obliteration of the arteriolar lumen == RBCs fragmentation (=schistocytes) 'n' PLT consumption == MAHA microangiopathic hemolytic anemia  Labor: inc Cr(s) + high BUN & MAHA = schistocytes (ie, fragmented RBCs) + high LDH + high indirect bilirubin   hyperplastic, below
