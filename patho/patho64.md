# Question
Neoplasia is new tissue growth which has three characteristics that distinguish it from hyperplasia and repair:   1. It is **unregulated**  2. It is **irreversible** 3. Generally speaking, it is **monoclonal***

# Answer
Benign lymph node enlargement in response to antigenic stimulation is associated with a polyclonal proliferation of lymphocytes; Whereas a monoclonal proliferation = strong evidence of malignancy  To contrast with hyperplasia, for ex: - mechanical stress induced hyperplasia of the uterus is regulated - there is hyperplasia of all the different types of cells that compose the uterus - once the baby has been delivered the uterus returns to normal size (via apoptosis of unneeded cells)    (3)*however, while it is monoclonal in origin, some cancers displays clonal heterogeneity, and thus monoclonality is NOT a requirement
