# Question
Treatment for IPF includes:   1. **Pirfenidone** = antifibrotic agent that inhibits TGF-β = total and bilateral PIRF 2. **Nintedanib**, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of PDGF, FGF, and VEGF = 3 of Nintendo proofs victory   * Bonus: What are the classical symptoms and histological findings of this interstitial lung disease?

# Answer
IPF = chronic, progressive fibrotic lung disease ~ recurrent episodes of lung injury and disordered healing  Persistent inflammation == excessive activity of growth factors normally involved in wound healing =   TGF-β transforming growth factor-beta (pirfenidone),  PDGF platelet-derived growth factor (nintedanib),  FGF fibroblastic growth factor (nintedanib), and  VEGF vascular endothelial growth factor (nintedanib).    == increased fibroblast activity, myofibroblast formation, and collagen production = pulmonary fibrosis.
