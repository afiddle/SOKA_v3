# Question
"Crescent formation on LM is diagnostic of RPGN, which progresses to renal failure within weeks to months, and classified based on IM immunofluorescence microscopy:   **Antiglomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM)** RPGN: Linear GBM deposits of IgG and C3   **Immune-complex** RPGN: ""Lumpy-bumpy"" granular pattern of staining for both Abs (eg, IgG, IgA) and complement   **Pauci-immune** RPGN: no immunoglobulin or complement deposits on the GBM, but high ANCA AntiNeutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibodies lvls"

# Answer
Anti-GBM RPGN: In some Pts, anti-GBM Abs cross-react with pulmonary alveolar basement membranes == pulmonary hemorrhages (Goodpasture syndrome)  Immune-complex RPGN: Can be a complication of poststreptococcal GN, SLE, IgA nephropathy, or Henoch-Sch√∂nlein purpura  Pauci-immune RPGN: Often ANCA-associated vasculitides (eg, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis) but can also be idiopathic. It is characterized by glomerular crescent formation w/o immunoglobulin or complement deposits
