# Question
A **frameshift** mutation occurs when there is a deletion or insertion of n nucleotides not divisible by **3** == misreading of all nucleotides downstream == nonfunctional protein formation

# Answer
As the name implies, frameshift mutations alter the reading frame of the genetic code == formation of nonfunctional proteins ~incorporation of many incorrect amino acids = cystic fibrosis, duchenne muscular dystrophy and Tay-sachs disease
