# Answer
folate deficiency + thymidine supplementation == less apoptosis = more RBC proliferation   Thymidine supplementation bypasses enzyme thymidylate synthase = to reduce RBC apoptosis    Folate deficiency inhibits the synthesis of nucleic acids (eg, thymidine particularly) == defective DNA synthesis 'n' inc apoptosis affecting hemopoietic cells = megaloblastic anemia
