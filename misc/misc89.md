# Question
What effect does dehydration have on RPF?    **Decreased RPF**

---

# Answer
RPF, when decreased, triggers a compensatory mechanism (: bc dec RPF = dec GFR is not good, we compensate via RAS to constrict efferent arterioles; efferent arteriol constriction == autoregulation to inc GFR == inc GFR == INC FF = good again
