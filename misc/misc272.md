# Question
**Multiple origins of replication** make eukaryotic DNA replication quick and effective despite the large size and complexity of the genome compared to that of prokaryotic organisms

---

# Answer
The key steps of DNA replication are similar in eukaryotes and prokaryotes (eg, Escherichia coli) and are as follows:Unwinding of double-stranded DNA by helicase to produce single-stranded DNAFormation of a replication forkSynthesis of RNA primers by the enzyme primaseSynthesis and concurrent proofreading of daughter DNA strands by DNA polymerasesRemoval and replacement of RNA primers with DNALigation of Okazaki fragments on lagging strands by the enzyme ligase
