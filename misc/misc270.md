# Question
**Histone acetyltransferases** catalyze the acetylation of lysine residues in the amino-terminal tails of histones. Which of the following is the most likely effect of this covalent modification on chromatin structure?   **Decreases the affinity of histones for DNA**

# Answer
When the affinity between the histone and DNA is reduced, the unpacked (euchromatin) DNA can be bound by transcriptional enzymes, promoting gene expression  When DNA is tightly bound to a histone, gene transcription does not occur, since binding sites for RNA polymerase II (which transcribes messenger RNA) will be occupied by the presence of the histone.
