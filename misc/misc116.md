# Question
**Tyrosine** is converted to **dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA)** via the enzyme **tyrosine hydroxylase** (with **tetrahydrobiopterin** as a cofactor)

# Answer
Tyrosine hydroxylase = converts tyrosine to L-DOPA = the precursor to DOPA, NORA, and epinephrine.  Tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency == decreased DOPA == progressive dystonia; dec in DOPA == dec in DOPA degradation products, such as homovanillic acid.
