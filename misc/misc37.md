# Question
A **Northern** blot is used to analyze **RNA sample** to detect splicing errors

---

# Answer
measure mRNA levels = gene expression  RNA splice error: point mutation in an intron X == skipping of an exon Y.  Before a strand of mRNA is mature, splicing of the introns must occur, which requires specific splice sites to be recognized by the spliceosome. If a splice site is masked, an intron may be inappropriately retained, or an exon may be erroneously removed    SNoW DRoP: Southern = DNA NORTHERN = RNA Western = Protein Southwestern = DNA-binding proteins
