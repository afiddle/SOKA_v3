# Question
How does the intrapleural pressure change during expiration (relative to atmosphere)?    **Less negative relative to atmosphere (Patm = 0 cm H2O)::intrapleural P goes from -5 cm H2O to -8 cm H2O**

# Answer
Variation in intrapleural P goes from -8 cm H2O to -5 cm H2O (at end-expiration)  - Resting equilibrium = end-expiration aka begin of inspiration = -5 cm H2O = minimal value
