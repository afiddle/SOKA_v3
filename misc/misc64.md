# Question
How does the intrapleural pressure change during inspiration (relative to atmosphere)?    **More negative relative to the Patm of 0 cm H2O::intrapleural P goes from -5 cm H2O to -8 cm H2O**

# Answer
Variation in intrapleural P goes from -5 cm H2O to -8 cm H2O (during maximal inspiration)  - Resting equilibrium = end-expiration aka begin of inspiration = -5 cm H2O = minimal value
