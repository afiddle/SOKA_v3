# Question
**Linkage disequilibrium** describes the tendency of alleles at two loci to be inherited together more or less often than expected by chance

---

# Answer
To estimate the expected P of 2 alleles from separate loci appearing together, multiply their occurrence rates.  Note that the Hardy-Weinberg principle (2pq) is not applicable when considering alleles at different loci.   xy haplotype frequency = [Frequency of x] × [Frequency of y] = 0.3 × 0.2 = 0.06
