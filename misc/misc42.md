# Question
**Genetic imprinting** is the normal differential expression of an allele depending on parental origin (e.g. only one allele is active); caused by DNA methylation

# Answer
Genomic imprinting = phenomenon in which an offspring's genes are expressed in a parent-specific manner    DNA methylation = epigenetic process in which genes can be silenced by attaching methyl groups to cytosine residues in the DNA molecule
