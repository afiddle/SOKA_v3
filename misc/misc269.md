# Question
What are the key factors governing fluid movement between capillaries and interstitial space, and how do they contribute to peripheral edema?  Fluid exchange is governed by **hydrostatic and oncotic pressures** b/w capillaries 'n' interstitial space. Imbalances in these pressures (ie, **excess intestitial fluid** that can't be removed by the lympathic system == **overwhelmed lympathic system**) lead to the development of peripheral edema.    For instance, high capillary hydrostatic pressure and low plasma oncotic pressure facilitate fluid movement out of capillaries, leading to interstitial fluid accumulation

# Answer
Conversely, high interstitial hydrostatic pressure and low interstitial oncotic pressure can mitigate this effect.
