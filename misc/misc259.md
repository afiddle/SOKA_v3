# Question
A 5yo boy is stung on his foot by a bee. Within 30 minutes the local area is edematous. The extravascular accumulation of fluid is most directly related to **gap formation between endothelial cells**

# Answer
== weakened junctions between endothelial cells, allowing extravasation of fluid into the interstitial space == local swelling  Bee venom = melittin active peptides = hydrolyzing cellular membranes == local damage; Melittin inc cellular permeability, induces synthesis of arachidonic acid through phospholipase-A2 == damaging the vascular endothelium  Also, mast cell degranulation releases histamine == local vasodilation
