# Question
In females, one of two X-chromosomes is condensed and its genes turned off by **cytosine methylation**, forming heterochromatin (lyonization)

# Answer
Inactivated X chromosome into compact heterochromatin (Barr body); It has a low level of transcriptional activity.   Heterochromatin = condensed chromatin = composed of heavily methylated DNA & associated with deacetylated histones   In contrast, euchromatin = loosely arranged & high level of transcriptional activity
