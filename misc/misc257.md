# Question
The more reduced a substrate is, the more it can reduce FAD or NAD+ to FADH2 or NADH. Therefore, heavily **hydrogenated** substrates supply the **greatest** amount of **energy**

# Answer
The reduced NAD+ molecule = NADH = transports energy stored as protons (hydrogen atoms). Similarly, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) transports hydrogens as hydrated FAD (=FADH2).  Both compounds donate e- to the electron transport chain (ETC) to generate ATP via ATP synthase, powered by a hydrogen gradient across the mitochondrial membrane
