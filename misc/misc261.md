# Question
**F2,6-BP Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate** is produced during **fed state::starvation or fed state** from fructose 6-phosphate by phosphofructokinase-2. In turn, F2,6-BP activates phosphofructokinase-1, a key regulatory step in glycolysis, promoting ongoing degradation of glucose.   In the fasting state, F2,6-BP concentration will be **decreased**

# Answer
B/c of the lack of available glucose as a substrate for its synthesis. This will downregulate glycolysis.
