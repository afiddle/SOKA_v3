# Question
What is the approximate sensitivity and specificity (high or low) on the receiver operating characteristic curve below?   Sensitivity: **high** Specificity: **low**

---

# Answer
'E' and 'X' points are the most appropriate cut point between normal and abnormal results for a screening test of fatal conditions for which early detection is key, sensitivity should be prioritized   sensitivity is directly proportional to true positive rate; specificity is inversely proportional to true negative rate
