# Question
What equation is used to calculate genotypic frequency when using Hardy-Weinberg population genetics?   **p2 + 2pq + q2 = 1**

# Answer
"The frequency (hetero- and homozygosity) of dominant 'n' recessive alleles within a population can be determined using the 1# incidence of the disease, and the 2# equations:  p + q = 1  p² + 2pq + q² = 1  Where p = frequency of the dominant q = frequency of the recessive  2pq = frequency of the carrier of a recessive disease   In a population with a recessive allele frequency of 0.1, the frequency of heterozygosity is roughly 0.2"
