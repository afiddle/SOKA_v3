# Question
The final stage of excitation-contraction coupling is myocyte relaxation, which occurs subsequent to calcium efflux from the cytoplasm. Intracellular calcium is removed primarily via an **Na+/Ca2+ exchange pump::NCX** and sarcoplasmic reticulum **Ca2+-ATPase pump::SERCA**

# Answer
NCX (ie, Na+/Ca2+ exchange pump) uses the large extracellular Na+ concentration gradient to help pump Ca2+ out of the cell and, in the process, removes one intracellular Ca2+ in exchange for 3 extracellular Na+ ions  In contrast, SERCA (ie, a Ca2+-ATPase pump) actively transfers Ca2+ from the cytosol to the lumen of sarcoplasmic reticulum at the expense of ATP hydrolysis
