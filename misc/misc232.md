# Question
"CN III dysfunction leads to a characteristic triad of:  **blown pupil often w ""down and out"" gaze** + **efferent pupillary defect** + **ptosis**"

---

# Answer
CN III = motor (central) innervation to all but RL6SO4 extraocular mm + + parasympathetic (peripheral) innervation to the pupil + + somatic innervation of the levator palpebrae superioris  Left, eg, efferent pupillary defect = absent left pupillary response when light enters either eye
