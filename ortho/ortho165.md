# Question
"The sarcomere contains regions made of thick **(myosin)::dark gray** filaments, and thin **(actin)::light gray** filaments or a combination of them to provide muscle contraction. Rules of thumb:  > 3 bands = *read out loud* = A, I, H bands > 2 lines = ""Multishades"" of gray line & ""black Zebra"" line > 2 filaments = thin actin & thick myosin = respectively light & dark when alone   - The A band possesses all shades of gray = borders of darkest gray, H band inside of it, and M line centered; the one who possesses all shades of gray remains the same (length) - The **light gray::shape of gray** I band has actin thin filaments = I act through the light w/a ""black Zebra"" inside - The **darkest gray band::shape of gray band** contains myosin filaments only = My darkest age / H band  - The **""black Zebra""::color/name** line = overlapped actin, tropomyosin, and troponin filaments = black to black, Z to Z equals sarcomere - The two darkest gray lines bordering the A band = actin 'n' myosin filaments overlapping  - The ""Multishades"" of gray line inside the A band = **site where thin 'n' thick slide over toward the M line**"

# Answer
"black Zebra line = ""light gray*light gray=black"" = overlapped actin filamentds ""light gray*dark gray=darker gray lines bordering the A band = actin and myosin overlapping Multi thin and thick slide over Me"
