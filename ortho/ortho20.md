# Question
If there is unilateral **conductive** hearing loss, the Rinne test demonstrates **bone** > **air** conduction

# Answer
better at mastoid? abnormal Rinne test = conductive hearing loss (= impaired transmission of air vibrations to the inner ear) i.e. no air conduction after bone conduction is gone (abnormal)
