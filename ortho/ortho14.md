# Question
**Primary carnitine** deficiency is an inherited defect in the transport of long chain fatty acids into the mitochondria

---

# Answer
Long-chain 'n' very long-chain fatty acids require carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase to enter the mitochondrial matrix for beta-oxidation.  - Symptoms: encephalopathy, vomiting, hypoketotic hypoglycemia, hyperammonemia, muscle weakness, skeletal myopathy, CMPs, and ventricular dysrhythmias. - Triggers = illness or fasting - Tx = adm of a low-fat (medium-chain fatty acids), high-carbohydrate formula and carnitine supplementation.    deficiency may be in CAT1, CAT2, or carnitine transporter
