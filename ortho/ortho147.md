# Question
What is the likely dx in a Pt w/ acute posterior calf pain/swelling while walking? Physical examination shows tenderness/induration at the medial head of the gastrocnemius and a crescent-shaped patch of ecchymosis at the medial malleolus.   **Ruptured popliteal cyst**

# Answer
- due to extrusion of synovial fluid from knee joint into gastrocneumius/semimembranosus bursa, often in those with underlying osteoarthritis  - ddx. with DVT (onset with exercise, location of tenderness, ecchymosis at medial malleolus)
