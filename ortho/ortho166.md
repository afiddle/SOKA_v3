# Question
Strong inducers of CYP-450 enzymes (eg, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital) induce CYP24 (eg, 24-hydroxylase CYP24A1), which converts **25-hydroxyvitamin D::the substrate** to **24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D::inactive form**. As a result, there is less **25-hydroxyvitamin D::substrate** available for conversion to its active form, **1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D::active**.     Deficiency of **1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D::active** leads to decreased intestinal absorption of Ca2+. The resulting compensatory **increase** in PTH secretion causes increased release of Ca2+ from bones and progressive loss of bone mineral density.
