# Question
In knee osteoarthritis, exercises to strengthen the quadriceps muscles can reduce abnormal loading on the joint and protect the **articular cartilage** from further stress

# Answer
cartilage supports pressure b/c of chondroitin sulfate and its polar nature, responsible for creating a gel-like medium resilient to shock; - chondroitin sulfate occupies a larger volume in solution x dehydrated solid given its many surface negative charges and strong affinity with H2O. - In solution 'n' heavily hydrated == increased overall complex volume
