# Question
**Isotonic::Type** muscle contraction refers to contraction under constant force or tension, with resultant change in the length of the muscle fiber.  In contrast, **isometric** contraction = generation of force w/o a change in length.    What would determine the maximum rate of shortening?  Interactions between actin and myosin via **cross-bridge contraction cycling**

# Answer
The faster the rate of cross-bridge recycling, the higher the rate of shortening
