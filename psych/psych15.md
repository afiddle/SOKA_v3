# Question
**Duchenne** muscular dystrophy is typically due to frameshift or non-sense mutations, resulting in a truncated or absent dystrophin protein

---

# Answer
"""Duchenne = Deleted Dystrophin"" the most common = frameshift mutation of the dystrophin gene, which encodes the dystrophin protein on X cmsm p21   Dystrophin provides a stabilizing interaction bw the sarcolemma and the intracellular contraction apparatus, and mutation affecting this sarcollema-cytoskeleton (actin) linked protein == membrane damage and myonecrosis  x Becker, where dystrophin is mutated"
