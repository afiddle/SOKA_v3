# Answer
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a standardized modality of psychotherapy that targets persistent maladaptive thought patterns and behaviors.  CBT is used as monotherapy or in combination with medication to treat a variety of mental illnesses (eg, anxiety, mood, personality, somatic symptom, and eating disorders).  Treatment is generally time limited (approximately 5-20 sessions).  Patients work with therapists to identify and change cognitive distortions, such as overgeneralization (e.g. patient believes ALL of her colleagues dislike her), catastrophizing (fears being fired), and minimizing positive events (disregards that she is being considered for promotion), as well as changing avoidance behaviors that stem from these distortions.Biofeedback involves using signals from the body (e.g. heart rate, muscle tension, skin temperature, blood pressure) as indicators of emotional distress.  Patients are taught to identify and control their responses to various stimuli.Dialectical behavioral therapy was developed for borderline personality disorder and targets the emotional dysregulation and self-destructive and suicidal behaviors associated with this disorder.Interpersonal psychotherapy is an evidenced-based therapy for depression that focuses on the interplay between depressive symptoms and interpersonal stressors.  This patient suffers more from anxiety than depression.  Her cognitive distortions and avoidance behaviors are more suited to treatment with CBT.Motivational interviewing is commonly used to treat substance abuse and involves the therapist assuming a nonjudgmental stance, acknowledging ambivalence, focusing on the patient's motivation for change, and tolerating resistance to change.Psychodynamic psychotherapy focuses on the role of unconscious conflict and gaining insight into how past experience shapes present situations.  It does not specifically target thought patterns and avoidance behaviors.Supportive psychotherapy is used to reinforce a patient's ability to cope with stressors and is commonly used for low-functioning patients or patients in crisis who are at risk of decompensation.  For a more stable patient, like this woman, CBT provides a more in-depth and targeted approach.
