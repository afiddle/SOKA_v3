# Question
How do mutations in the **long terminal repeat::LTR** region of HIV-1 affect its life cycle, particularly in the context of viral replication?  Mutations in the **LTR region** of HIV-1 can result in decreased viral replication by affecting the **integration of the provirus** into the host cell genome.

# Answer
Alterations in the LTR region, crucial for integrating the viral genome into the host's DNA 'n' the production of new viral particles == impair provirus integration into the host genome == decreased viral replication.
