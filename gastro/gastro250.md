# Question
Patients with **upper::upper/lower** GI bleeding often have an elevated blood urea nitrogen; due to incd nitrogen absorption to the gut in the Hb form, which is then converted to ammonia and absorbed into *bloodstream*.  The ammonia enters the liver through the portal vein and is detoxified to urea. Unless there's chro liver failure == accumulation of ammonia == hepatic encephalopathy

# Answer
Patients with upper (but not lower) GI bleeding often have an elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and elevated BUN/creatinine ratio   Possible causes include increased urea production from intestinal breakdown of Hb (which has amino acids) and increased urea reabsorption in the proximal tubule due to associated hypovolemia
