# Question
**Black::color** pigment gallstones are radio-**opaque** and composed of **calcium bilirubinate** due to supersaturation of bilirubin

# Answer
- Arise with chronic hemolysis (eg, sickle cell anemia, hereditary spherocytosis, and thalassemia) increasing circulating free bilirubin lvls, which is taken up by the liver == increased efflux of bilirubin into bile   - And ileal disease (eg, Crohn) or resection allows bile acids (normally reabsorbed *ileum*) to spill into the colon; Bile acids solubilized unconj. bili == bile reabsorption 'n' [bile] = altered enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin
