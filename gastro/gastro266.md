# Question
Unlike hepatic adenomas, **focal nodular hyperplasia** lesions have a central stellate scar on gross pathology examination, are generally stable and rarely complicated by spontaneous rupture and hemorrhage

---

# Answer
- Focal nodular hyperplasia is a common benign liver tumor - Found incidentally on imaging in women between the ages of 20â€“50 - Treated conservatively if patients are asymptomatic; follow-up imaging at 3 and 6 months is generally recommended to confirm the stability of the lesions, after which no further imaging is required
