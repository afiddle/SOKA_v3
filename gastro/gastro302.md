# Answer
The vitelline (omphalomesenteric) duct, a structure that connects the midgut lumen w/ the yolk sac, due to obliteration of the omphalomesenteric duct during early embryologic development == Meckel diverticulum = painless lower GI bleeding  Incomplete obliteration can result in a spectrum of anomalies, including vitelline duct cyst (ie, cyst connected by fibrous bands to the ileum and umbilicus) and Meckel diverticulum
