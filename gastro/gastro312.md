# Question
Mannitol (ie, an osmotically active carbohydrate monomer) infusion (400mM) in a healthy person is most likely to cause which change in plasma osmolality and plasma ADH (vasopressin) concentration?  **A) Increased** plasma osmolality, and **increased** ADH production

# Answer
It raises serum osmolality when given as an infusion. Mannitol, when infused, is a hyperosmolar solution. Osmoreceptors detect the change in osmolality and trigger the production of ADH by the hypothalamus 'n' post pit gland release
