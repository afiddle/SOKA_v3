# Question
Parietal cells, located in the fundus and body of the stomach, secrete large quantities of **gastric acid (HCl)** and intrinsic factor. **HCl secretion** is stimulated by histamine, ACh, and gastrin, but prostaglandins inhibit it. **Gastrin** not only stimulates **gastric acid secretion**, but it also has a trophic effect on parietal cells.

# Answer
In Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, gastrin hypersecretion == parietal cell hyperplasia = visible enlargement of gastric folds on endoscopy.  The inc HCL secretion induced by excess gastrin also causes peptic ulcer disease, heartburn, and diarrhea    - Gastrin = produced by gastric G cells, stimulates parietal cells == hydrochloric acid production - Recurrent, chronic duodenal or jejunal ulcers == abdm pain, diarrhea 2ry to malabsorption, and possible hematemesis, melena, or hematochezia. - Immunohistochemistry: positive staining for gastrin in neoplastic cells
