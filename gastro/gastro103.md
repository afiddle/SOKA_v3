# Answer
"Control the case in the OR, sometimes you have to fight ""X""   OR quantifies the relationship between an exposure and a disease; its null value, aka null hypothesis value, is always 1 (ie, OR = 1)  i.e. the odds an event (e.g. disease) occuring given a certain exposure vs. the odds of an event in the absence of that exposure"
