# Answer
- SCC = upper 2/3rds, & RFs = smoking, alcohol, hot liquids, and strictures. Bx = aberrant cells producint keratin and small foci of keratinization aka keratin pearls  In contrast, esophageal adenocarcinoma = lower / distal 1/3rd = chronic GERD, Barrett Esophagus, and obesity. Bx = glandular epithelium forming acinar, gland-like structures
