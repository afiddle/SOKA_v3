# Answer
secretin stimulates the release of gastrin by gastrinoma cells; in contrast, normal gastric G cells are inhibited by secretin  - Gastrin = produced by gastric G cells, stimulates parietal cells == hydrochloric acid production - Recurrent, chronic distal duodenal or jejunal ulcers == abdm pain, diarrhea 2ry to malabsorption, and possible hematemesis, melena, or hematochezia. - Immunohistochemistry: positive staining for gastrin in neoplastic cells
