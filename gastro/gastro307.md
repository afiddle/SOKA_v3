# Question
A 25yo is lost in the desert for 1 week w/ water but no food. Which of the following changes in enzyme activities and regulatory molecule concentrations in liver is most likely in this fasting state?  - **Decreased::glycolysis will be decreased or increased?** Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate aka F2,6-BP - **Decreased::glycolysis-related** Pyruvate Kinase - **Increased/Upregulated::hepatic gluconeogenesis will be decreased or increased?** Phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) Carboxykinase (CK) aka PEPCK - **Increased/Upregulated::hepatic gluconeogenesis-related** Glucose 6-phosphatase aka G6Pase

# Answer
First day of fasting = usage of glycogen stores  In the fasting state, enzymes and regulatory molecules that promote gluconeogenesis, glycogen degradation, fatty acid degradation, protein degradation, and ketogenesis are upregulated or increased in concentration.  After the first day (glycogen stores depleted) = hepatic gluconeogensis = responsible for serum glucose maintenance == upregulation of glucose 6-phosphatase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase
