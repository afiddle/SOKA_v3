# Question
What histologic feature distinguishes the jejunum from other parts of the small intestine?   **Plicae circulares** == increased mucosal surface area

# Answer
jejunum (above) = larger caliber, thicker mm walls, longer vasa rectae, and fewer arcades. Histology = Peyer patches 'n' mucosal lymphoid follicles   note: plicae circulares may also be present in the distal duoneum and proximal ileum
