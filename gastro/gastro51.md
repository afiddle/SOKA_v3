# Question
"**Right** heart failure is associated with a characteristic ""**nutmeg**"" appearance of the liver"

---

# Answer
"Dyspnea (+ ascites, hepatomegaly, JVD, lower extremity edema) = right-sided HF    normal liver x congestive hepatopathy = RHF complication = patchy hemorrhage + centrilobular necrosis (zone 3); others (eg, periportal = zone 1) appear normal == heterogeneous appearance ""nutmeg liver""     * JVD on physical examination = Also present in TR tricuspid regurgitation, constrictive pericarditis, cardiac tamponade, and IVC obstruction; helps distinguish from Budd-Chiari syndrome"
