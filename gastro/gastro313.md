# Question
Glutathione is a primary hepatic antioxidant. The **ratio of GSH to GSSG** reflects the degree of oxidation of the liverâ€™s supply of available, reduced glutathione. Hepatic metabolism of drugs that produce oxidative stress through the production of free radicals will deplete hepatic stores of GSH, leading to a decreased **ratio of GSH to GSSG**.

# Answer
- Glutathione = contains a sulfur atom = capable of reducing ROS reactive oxygen species and free radicals, neutralizing these molecules before they can cause DNA strand breaks, lipid peroxidation, and protein damage. - GSH = reduced gutathione with a hydrogenated sulfur group - GSSG = glutathione disulfide formed by two molecules of GSH oxidized
