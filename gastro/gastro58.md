# Question
Increased NADH/NAD+ ratio (eg, due to alcohol consumption) causes increased conversion of dihydroxyacetone phosphate == **glycerol-3-phosphate**, which combines with fatty acids to make triglycerides, leading to **hepatosteatosis::liver pathology**

---

# Answer
- Primarily, excess NADH production == inhibiting free fatty acid oxidation.  - Also, it enhances fatty acid formation 'n' glycerol-3-phosphate production == promoting triglyceride synthesis == triglyceride accumulation within hepatocellular cytoplasm
