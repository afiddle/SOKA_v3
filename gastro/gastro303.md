# Question
35yo, ED, with nausea, vomiting, and fever for 24h, unable to eat/drink since. Labor: normoglycemia, despite a 24-hour fast. Maintenance of this patient's blood glucose is facilitated by hepatic conversion of pyruvate into glucose. What substance directly stimulates the first enzyme involved in this process?   **Acetyl-CoA** is an obligate activator of **pyruvate carboxylase**

# Answer
The longer you fast, the more gluconeogenesis takes on the role of glucose production—it’s understandable, because as far as your body knows, you may be starving.   - Pyruvate to oxaloacetate, which undergoes gluconeogenesis to produce glucose   - Pyruvate to oxaloacetate is catalyzed by pyruvate carboxylase enzyme, which has increased activity by Acetyl-CoA
