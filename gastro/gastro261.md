# Question
**Indirect inguinal hernias::indirect inguinal hernias or varicoceles** are reducible with manipulation and feel like a soft-tissue mass

# Answer
cause = failure of the processus vaginals to close post-testes migration into the scrotal sac; they exit the abdominal cavity through the deep inguinal ring: - lateral to the inferior epigastric vessels, and - superior to the inguinal ligament  Abdominal contents extend into the scrotal sac through the superficial inguinal ring    varicoceles can't be reduced and feel like a bag of worms
