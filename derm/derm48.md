# Question
What is the likely diagnosis in a patient with a lesion on the foot (pictured below)? The lesion is non-tender, firm, hyperpigmented, and has a central dimple in the center when pinched at the edges.    **Dermatofibroma**      * DDX?

# Answer
due to fibroblast proliferation and occurs in lower extremities; the fibrous component causes the dimpling when pinched. Imagine a lot of fiber bunched together and going down into a dimple.
