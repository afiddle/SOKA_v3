# Question
"How to distinguish trichotillomania w/ other diseases?   **Pathy alopecia with hair regrowth at different lengths since the pt pulls out hairs at different time frames**   Diagnostics?   **Diagnosis is made by shaving a ""window"" at her scalp and assessing equal hair growth within the window; the regrowing hair is too short to be plucked, hence it's allowed to grow**"
