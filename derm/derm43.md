# Answer
risk of carcinoma is proportional to degree of epithelial dysplasia    premalignant lesions from atypical epidermal keratinocytes that DO NOT involve the full thickness of the epidermis; typically = sun exposed areas     On a continuum with SCC:  AK: disorganized, atypic cells (ie, hyperchromatic, pleomorphic nuclei), acanthosis (ie, epidermal thickening), and stratum corneum w/ hyperkeratosis & parakeratosis (ie, thickened & retained nuclei, respectively)  SCC in situ: epid. full thickness w/o infiltration  Invasive SCC: epid. full thickness w/ penetration into the dermis or deeper
