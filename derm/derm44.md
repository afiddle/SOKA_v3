# Answer
premalignant lesions from atypical epidermal keratinocytes that DO NOT involve the full thickness of the epidermis; typically = sun exposed areas      On a continuum with SCC: - SCC in situ: epid. full thickness w/o infiltration  - Invasive SCC: epid. full thickness w/ basement memb. penetration into the dermis or deeper    AK's histology: disorganized, atypic cells (ie, hyperchromatic, pleomorphic nuclei)  - mitotic activity (eg, acanthosis = epidermal thickening) - stratum corneum (ie, hyperkeratosis = thickened, & parakeratosis = retained nuclei)
