# Question
Acne vulgaris is due to chronic inflammation of hair follicles and associated **sebaceous** glands

# Answer
may result in comedones aka hair follicle blocked by keratin debris (white heads, black heads), pustules (pimples), or nodules (scarring)   Primary lesion, the comedone, is formed when the epithelial cells of the follicle accumulate and produce excess keratin debris. This clogs the follicle, allowing for the proliferation of bacteria and, eventually, follicle rupture.  Acne mechanica encompasses acne vulgares caused or exacerbated by mechanical friction, irritation, and obstruction of the follicles
