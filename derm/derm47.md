# Answer
BCC = keratinocytes *basal epidermis* central telangiectatic vessels skin-colored papule pearly appearance peripheral palisading/parallel alignment of cells  basal cell carcinoma from keratinocytes *basal epidermal layer/hair follicule* 1) skin-colored papule of pearl appearance,  2) peripheral parallel alignment (palisading of cells at periphery), and  3) nests of blue tumor cells)  typically appears as a pearly-pink papule with central telangiectatic vessels; it may have central ulceration! palisading of cells at the periphery (= parallel alignment)
