# Question
What is the most common form of melanoma in African-Americans and Asians with darker skin individuals?   **Acral lentiginious melanoma**   * Bonus: what are the main sites of presentation?

# Answer
acral sites aka distal extremities = nails, palms, fingers, soles or toes; UV-radiation exposure is noncontributory to its development
