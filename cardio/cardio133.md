# Question
When the **posterior descending artery (PDA)** arises from the **RCA right coronary** artery, it is referred to as right-dominant circulation (85%)    * Bonus: When is an isolated RV MI possible (artery occluded & dominance)?

# Answer
In virtually all patients, the RV = fully supplied by the RCA. In contrast, in patients with left-dominant circulation, none of the inferior LV wall is supplied by the RCA.   Therefore, isolated RV myocardial infarction (MI) ~ RCA occlusion in a patient with left-dominant circulation.    Given the low prevalence of left-dominant circulation, isolated RV MI is an uncommon event (approximately 3% of MIs).  RCA-only to supply the PDA = right-dominant  - RCA right coronary = 70-80% - LCx left cx = 5-10% - codominance = 10-20% the atrioventricular (AV) nodal artery most often arises from the dominant coronary artery
