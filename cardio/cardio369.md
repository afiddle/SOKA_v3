# Question
Coarctation of the aorta = HTN in **upper** & HOS in **lower** extremities    A(n) **midsystolic or continuous** murmur heard best **over the back (ie, interscapular area)**; and **notching of the ribs** on CXR  Treat with **surgical decompression** OR die of a ruptured cerebral aneurysm w extensive IC hemorrhage

# Answer
"Murmur can be systolic OR continuous.    DDX = BP between upper & lower extremities = aortic coarctation, which can present with hypertension, headaches, blurred vision, epistaxis, and lower extremity claudication (due to reduced blood flow). A continuous murmur can be heard at the left interscapular area due to turbulent flow across the coarctation or through large collateral vessels.     Confirmatory dx = echocardiogram = aortic narrowing and also helps identify other commonly associated congenital heart defects (e.g. bicuspid aortic valve)   Alternative treatment option: percutaneous balloon aortoplasty     In contrast, PDA is a continuous murmur heard at the left subclavicular region that is ""machinery"" or ""to-and-fro"", reflecting the wide pulse pressure it creates   All symptoms related to too much blood flow in the upper half of the body (headache, cerebral aneurysms, aortic dissection) and too little blood flow in the lower half of the body (underdevelopment, cold legs, claudication w/ exercise, leg fatigue, delayed femoral pulses). ECG shows LVH."
