# Question
How do the following parameters change in an acute MI patient with hypotension, bibasilar crackles, and a systolic murmur (cardiac apex)?   Left atrial size: **No change** LV end-diastolic pressure: **Increased**   * bonus: what's the dx and the left catheterization finding?

# Answer
In the setting of MR, an incompetent mitral valve allows backflow of blood from the left ventricle during ventricular systole, leading to markedly elevated left atrial pressure during this time. This creates an early and large V wave, the characteristic pressure tracing finding in patients with MR.  The patient has acute mitral regurgitation, which causes elevated LA and LV filling pressures (compliance and size are affected in chronic MR but not acute) and pulmonary edema but does not acutely result in changes in size; during diastole there's more filling of the LV due to regurgitated blood from previous cycle  The elevated left atrial pressure in MR leads to atrial dilation and often precipitates atrial fibrillation, symptomatically manifesting with palpitations. Over time, decompensated heart failure, evidenced by dyspnea and orthopnea in this patient, can also occur.
