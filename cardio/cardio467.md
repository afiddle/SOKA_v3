# Question
"There are eight valvular heart diseases. Four are regurgitations, and four stenosis. They are divided into a 2/2 pattern of diastolic, and 2/2 of systolic murmurs:  ""AoP regurgitations are diastolic, Ms. T!"" Said Mr. TRiPle-ASS   Ao = Aortic Regurgitation = **diastolic decrescendo** murmur best heard *right 2º ICS*  PR = Pulmonary Regurgitation = **diastolic** murmur best heard *left 2º ICS*  MS = Mitral Stenosis = **OS followed by a diastolic rumble** loudest over the apex, radiating to the axilla  T = Tricuspid Stenosis = **diastolic w/an OS** murmur best heard *left LSB*  MR = Mitral Regurgitation = **holosystolic** murmur best heard *apex, left 4º or 5º ICS*, midclavicular line radiating to the left axilla  TR = Tricuspid Regurgitation = **holosystolic** murmur best heard *left LSB*  PS = Pulmonic Stenosis = **crescendo-decrescendo systolic** murmur best heard *left 2º ICS*, quieter and radiating less to the lower neck x ASS  ASS = Aortic Stenosis = **crescendo-decrescendo systolic** murmur best heard *right USB, radiating to the carotids"

# Answer
"""AoP regurgitations are diastolic, Ms. T!"" = AoR, PR, MS and TS  Said (=systolic) MR. TRiPle-ASS → MR, TR, PS and ASS; Triple = huge = holosystolic"
