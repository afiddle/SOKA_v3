The **vascular** function curve is a plot of the relationship between **venous return** and right atrial **pressure**

# Answer
VRET-VRAP; vascular function curve = venous return x RAP  opposed to the cardiac, the vascular function curve refers to the decrease in venous return from the body as central venous CVP (ie, RA pressure) increases; b/c venous return = determined by the pressure gradient b/w the systemic capillary beds and the RA
