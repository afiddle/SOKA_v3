# Question
What change in heart rate is expected during the valsalva maneuver if the patient's baroreceptor reflex is intact?   **Increased HR**

# Answer
Valsalva maneuver == Increase in intrathoracic pressure == decreasing venous return to the heart & subsequently CO; heart rate should increase to compensate Release (ie, relaxation) phase == venous return to the RA increases, and encourages the PFO to open.
