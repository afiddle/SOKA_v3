# Question
**Exercise** effects on LV P-V loop = **increases everything** that matters on LV cardiac cycle, overall:   = inc Preload (+V) = inc contractility (+HR) = inc SV (+V pumped per beat) = inc SBP, ie, there's an urge, a pressure to fill the mm with blood = inc Afterload   == inc CO

# Answer
Systolic BP and PP increase while DBP remains the same   Pulse pressure (PP) = amount that arterial pressure increases above DBP during LV contraction PP ~ SV and  PP ~ 1/Aortic compliance (constant but decreases with aging).
