# Question
Booming S1 with exertional dyspnea is suggestive of **mitral stenosis::condition**

---

# Answer
S1 = closure of the atrioventricular (mitral and tricuspid) valves as the ventricular pressures exceed atrial pressures at the beginning of systole. They close almost simultaneously. Thus, S1 is a single sound.   thickened mitral valves = louder sound upon closure (analogy of thick book slamming together) At rest, normal diastolic pressure, normal afterload, normal contractility in early, mild MS
