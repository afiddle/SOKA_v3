# Question
**Chronic** mesenteric ischemia may occur due to severe hypotension or **atherosclerosis** of the celiac artery, SMA, or IMA

# Answer
High-grade stenosis due to atherosclerosis involving *celiac and mesenteric arteries*, the bowel can suffer from diminished blood supply.   Intestinal hypoperfusion = pronounced within an hour after meals when more blood is needed for the digestion/absorption of nutrients (intestinal angina).   This is analogous to stable cardiac angina, chest pain that occurs with physical exertion due to increased myocardial oxygen demand.   SMA & IMA are connected by a pair of anastomoses:  - the marginal artery of Drummond = the principal; and the inconsistently present - arc of Riolan (mesenteric meandering artery).
