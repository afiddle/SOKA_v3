# Question
What is the management for calcium-channel-blocker induced peripheral edema?   **ACE inhibitors or ARBs**

---

# Answer
ACE inhibitors and ARBs == vasodilation of the postcapillary blood vessels   When used in combination with CCBs == reduction of the transcapillary pressure = significantly reduce the risk of developing CCB-related peripheral edema
