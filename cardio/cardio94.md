# Question
What is the effect of aerobic exercise (=overall reduced SVR) on pulse pressure?    SBP = DBP + PP    **Increased pulse pressure**

# Answer
Systolic BP and PP increase while DBP remains the same   Pulse pressure (PP) = amount that arterial pressure increases above DBP during LV contraction   PP ~ SV and  PP ~ 1/Aortic compliance (constant but decreases with aging).
