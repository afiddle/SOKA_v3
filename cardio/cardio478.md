# Question
Both have characteristic P2 pulmonic components of S2, but differ in intensity:  PAH Pulmonary HTN = **loud S2**, and an accentuated, palpable impulse *LSB* PS Pulmonic stenosis = **delayed, soft S2**

# Answer
PAH = loud S2, and an ccentuated, palpable impulse *LSB* = left parasternal lift ~ RV emit PS delays the occurrence of P2 (later valve closure), but typically leads to a softer P2 intensity
