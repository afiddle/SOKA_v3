# Question
What is the likely diagnosis in a young child that presents with failure to thrive and easy fatigability with a grade II holosystolic murmur best heard over the LLSB with a diastolic rumble over the cardiac apex? There is also a loud P2.    **Large ventricular septal defect (VSD)**

# Answer
- symptoms due to left → right shunting → pulmonary overcirculation and less to systemic - larger VSDs tend to be quieter (grade II) due to less turbulence - the diastolic rumble is heard due to increased flow across the mitral valve - Loud P2 due to L → R shunting and pulmonary HTN
