# Question
Dilation of the LV = consequence of **systolic dysfunction::ie, Ischemic CAD, Dilated CMP** or **regurgitations::ie, MR and AR**    Chronic Voverload == progressive eccentric hypertrophy that eventually leads to reduced LV **contractility / contraction force** and decompensated HF

# Answer
"â€œThe exquisite MR ARID, a serial killer"" = ECCentric AR or MR, Ischemic CAD or Dilated CMP ~ V overload = sarcomere in series    valvular = MR and AR  systolic dysfunction = Ischemic (obstructive coronary artery disease) , Dilated CMP"
