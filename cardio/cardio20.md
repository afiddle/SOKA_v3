# Question
Decreased activity of the Ca2+-Na+ exchanger (eg, due to digoxin or cardiac glycosides) causes **increased** intracellular Ca2+ concentration

# Answer
Ca2+ influx into the cytoplasm from the sarcoplasmic reticulum == myocyte contraction   Removal of Ca2+ from the cytoplasm when contraction is no longer needed (eg, during myocardial diastole) is critical
