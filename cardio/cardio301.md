# Question
What is the likely diagnosis in a patient with a history of a stab wound that develops progressive weakness and exertional dyspnea with widened pulse pressure, tachycardia, and brisk carotid upstroke?    **High-output heart failure (secondary to AV fistula formation)**

# Answer
"- blood is shunted via the AV fistula from the arterial to the venous system, thus increasing preload without oxygenating the distal tissue. The fistula itself decreases systemic vascular resistance.  - in order to get enough oxygen to the distal tissue which isn't perfused, we increase heart rate, stroke volume, and therefore cardiac output (i.e. ""high-output""). also MAP = CO * TPR and ↓ TPR is offset by ↑ CO.   - eventually this'll lead to HF since the heart is working so hard. - doppler US is the preferred test for diagnosis and surgical therapy may be warranted"
