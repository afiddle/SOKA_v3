# Question
"Tetralogy of Fallot presents with **cyanosis::most common symptom**, Tet spells, and a(n) **crescendo-decrescendo::nature of the murmur** murmur at the **LUSB::anatomic location**. CXR classically shows **upturning of the cardiac apex (""boot-shaped heart"")**, although echocardiogram is the tool of choice"

# Answer
"Degree of clinical symptoms depend on the degree of RV outflow obstruction (stenosis). Treat with surgery    ""Boot-shaped heart"" occurs in ToF ~ pulmonic stenosis and == RV hypertrophy.  Patients typically present with cyanosis early in life.    Congenital heart defects only account for 2% of heart disease in adults. They are low-yield."
