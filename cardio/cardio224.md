# Question
Vitamin B12 and folate deficiency result in mildly elevated **homocysteine** levels, increasing risk for thrombosis

due to decreased conversion of homocysteine to methionine  BOTH = homocysteine buildup & lack of methionine; However, B12 def. would have methylmalonic acid buildup in addition  Increased methylmalonic acid = B12 deficiency biomarker
