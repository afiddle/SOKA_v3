# Question
The resting membrane potential of cardiac cells is determined primarily by **potassium (K+)** ions

---

# Answer
major location = intracellular; equilibrium potential = -90mV  Na+, K+, and Cl- ions = determine electrical potential difference (voltage) across a membrane (membrane potential).    Under normal physiologic conditions, there is a LOW intracellular [Na+ and Cl- ions] and HIGH [K+ ions] in the cytoplasm. Conversely, the extracellular space = high [Na+ and Cl- ions] and low [K+ ions].
