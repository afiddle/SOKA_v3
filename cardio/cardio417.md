# Question
Cardiogenic pulmonary edema is seen in **dilated cardiomyopathy::dilated cardiomyopathy / cardiac tamponade**  * Bonus: What can be seen on LM and gross pathology of the cardiogenic pulmonary edema?

# Answer
cardiac tamponade: - Problem of getting blood in to the right heart -> Beck's Triad (JVD, hypotension, distant heart sounds, alternans, clear lungs)  - Compare with cardiogenic shock, where we have JVD + crackles + S3 + hypotension
