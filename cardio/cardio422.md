# Question
Wide fixed split = **ASD::ASD/PS** Wide splitting increased during inspiration = **PS::ASD/PS**

---

# Answer
- ASD is associated with a wide fixed split (doesn't change during respiration)  - For pulmonary stenosis, MTA ___ P especially during inspiration due to more blood flow through pulmonic valve; PS also has a crescendo-descrecendo murmur at APTM
