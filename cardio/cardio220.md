# Question
Decreased ADAMTS13 (e.g. TTP) is usually due to an acquired **autoantibody**

# Answer
- Acquired TTP ~ formation of autoAb inhibitor x ADAMTS-13, a vWF-cleaving protease. - Circulating vWF is released as large vWF multimers that are cleaved to their regular size by ADAMTS-13 - In TTP, the large uncleaved vWF multimers = significantly prothrombotic == diffuse microvascular thrombosis
