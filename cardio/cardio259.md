# Question
Homocystinuria due to decreased affinity of cystathionine synthase for B6 is treated with very increased **B6** and increased **cysteine** in the diet

---

# Answer
- cystathione synthase deficiency or methionine synthase deficiency == inability to form cysteine from homocysteine - cysteine becomes essential in patients, and homocysteine buildup == elevated methionine == premature thromboembolic events ~homocysteine is prothrombotic  - methionine has to be avoided
