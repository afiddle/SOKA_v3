# Question
Significant impaired blood flow (eg, intestinal = acute mesenteric) and tissue ischemia are at risk of **lactic acidosis**

# Answer
Ischemia = anaerobic environment created == high NADH/NAD+ ratio;   This decreases activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase (converts pyruvate → acetyl-CoA) while stimulating lactate dehydrogenase (converts pyruvate → lactate), shunting the metabolic fate of pyruvate == lactate production
