# Question
*Significant coronary aa stenosis (eg, >50%)*    Perfusion pressure decreases distal to the stenosis, resulting in an initial  blood flow decrease   Coronary autoregulation stimulates **arteriolar vasodilation**, which reduces downstream **vascular resistance** for a corrective blood flow  increase at the new, reduced perfusion P, keeping near-normal blood flow, and prevent MI

# Answer
Ischemic myocardium triggers the release of vasodilators (eg, nitric oxide, adenosine), to facilitate arteriolar vasodilation and reduce downstream vascular resistance  Coronary autoregulation is limited in the setting of extreme changes in perfusion P
