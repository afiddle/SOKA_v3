# Question
Cardiac contractility increases with **decreased** extracellular Na+

---

# Answer
due to decreased activity of Na+-Ca2+ exchange   Ca2+ influx into the cytoplasm from the sarcoplasmic reticulum == myocyte contraction   Removal of Ca2+ from the cytoplam when contraction is no longer needed (eg, during myocardial diastole) is critical
