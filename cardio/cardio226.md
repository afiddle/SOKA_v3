# Question
**Amniotic fluid** emboli enter maternal circulation during labor or delivery   * Bonus: What are the underlying mechanisms related to the obstructive shock and the hemodynamic changes?

# Answer
catastrophic obstetric emergency; anaphylaxis-like reaction == cardiovascular collapse ~ respiratory failure ~ obstructive shock  - elevation in pulmonary P ~ potent pulmonary aa vasoconstriction = inc PVR pulm vascular resistance == obstructive shock = high CVP, low PCWP, and low cardiac index  >>> high CVP - impeded / obstructive cardiopulmonary blood flow == inc CVP (a reflection of RA pressure & RV preload) >>> low PCWP - decreased forward flow == red PCWP (a reflection of LA pressure & LV preload) >>> low cardiac index - as less blood is pumped TO THE L-heart, the cardiac index decreases == HOS >>> SVR increases == compensatory, incd SVR mechanism, as an attempt to maintain tisse perfusion presure
