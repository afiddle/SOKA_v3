# Question
Young, exertional dyspnea + OS opening snap + diastolic murmur over apex (mitral region) = **MS mitral stenosis::heart valve condition** ~ rheumatic fever sequelae   A decreased interval between the OS and **S2, specifically the A2 component ~ Ao closure** correlates with increased **MS** severity

# Answer
"(the longer the length of time bw S2 and the OS = the ""milder"" the OS, the opposite = severe)  OS ~ stenotic and calcified valve snapping open *mitral valve opening* = point 4"
