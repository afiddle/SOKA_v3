# Question
Does mitral stenosis cause a systolic or diastolic murmur?   **Diastolic**

---

# Answer
"""AoP regurgitations are diastolic, Ms T.! Ask MR. TRipple ASS!     (in MS, there are 4 total sounds: s1, s2, opening snap, then diastolic murmur)   OS point = stenotic mitral valve opening (the point in the image is not fixed, varies depending on severity, but always between S2-S1)"
