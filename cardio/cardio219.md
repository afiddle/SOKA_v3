# Question
**Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)** is due to inhibition or deficiency of the **ADAMTS13 (vWF metalloprotease)** enzyme

---

# Answer
- Acquired TTP ~ formation of autoAb inhibitor x ADAMTS-13, a vWF-cleaving protease. - Circulating vWF is released as large vWF multimers that are cleaved to their regular size by ADAMTS-13 - In TTP, the large uncleaved vWF multimers = significantly prothrombotic == diffuse microvascular thrombosis
