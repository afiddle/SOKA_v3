# Question
What class of drugs directly inhibit the Na+-K+ ATPase pump?   **Cardiac glycosides (eg, digoxin)**

# Answer
leads to indirect inhibition of Na+-Ca2+ exchange, thus increasing [Ca2+]i and increasing cardiac contractility    Ca2+ influx into the cytoplasm from the sarcoplasmic reticulum == myocyte contraction   Removal of Ca2+ from the cytoplam when contraction is no longer needed (eg, during myocardial diastole) is critical
