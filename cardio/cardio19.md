# Question
Increased intracellular [Na+] in cardiac myocytes causes decreased activity of the **Ca2+-Na+** exchanger

---

# Answer
e.g. due to cardiac glycosides (digoxin)    Ca2+ influx into the cytoplasm from the sarcoplasmic reticulum == myocyte contraction   Removal of Ca2+ from the cytoplam when contraction is no longer needed (eg, during myocardial diastole) is critical
