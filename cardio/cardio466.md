# Question
A short **duration of diastole** is the major limiting factor to supply LV myocardium with blood during exercise

# Answer
since LV blood supply happens during diastole; tachycardia, ie, increased heart rate shortens the time of ventricular relaxation and thus limits the coronary blood supply to the myocardium
