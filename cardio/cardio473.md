# Question
Malnourishment (eg, due to chronic alcohol use disorder) results in the depletion of **phosphate**.  Fast adm of dextrose-containing IV fluids increases insulin secretion, which stimulates the redistribution of **phosphate** from the serum into muscle and hepatic cells for use during glycolysis, which leads to profound **hypophosphatemia** and refeeding syndrome.

# Answer
Lack of adequate intracellular phosphate == failure of cellular energy metabolism, producing the clinical features of refeeding syndrome (eg, muscular weakness, arrhythmias, congestive heart failure).
