# Question
A female-appearing child with virilization at puberty, bilateral undescended testes, and no breasts is suggestive of **5α-reductase deficiency::diagnosis**

---

# Answer
"- D/t lack of dihydrotestosterone, which is necessary for external genitalia development; androgens also inhibit breast development - Female with masculinzation at puberty due to testes producing ↑↑ testosterone ""saturating"" limited 5a-reductase and making DHT - Compare with CAIS where there's no masculinization due to inability of androgens to function and there is breast development since androgens can't inhibit breast tissue - Compare with congenital adrenal hyperplasia: 46XX - no testes"
