# Question
What is the preferred adjuvant treatment for ER+ breast cancer in premenopausal women?   **Tamoxifen**   * Bonus: what genetic variation can predict treatment efficacy or relapse?

# Answer
Tamoxifen = selective estrogen receptor modulator = tx of ER+ breast CA = is a prodrug metabolized by CYP2D to its active metabolite, endoxifen.  In the breast, estrogen receptor antagonist == competitive inhibition of estradiol binding to its receptor  Endometrial hyperplasia/CA = due to estrogen agonist activity in endometrial and bone tissue
