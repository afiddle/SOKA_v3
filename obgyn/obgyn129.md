# Question
When performing a maternal serum quadruple screen, accurate estimation of **gestational age** with US is very important to determine whether levels of analyses are abnormal; If accurate, aneuploidies (trisomy 18 & 21) = low alpha-fetoprotein  * Bonus: How to distinguish trisomies from neural tube or abdominal wall defects?

# Answer
Neural tube or abdominal wall defects? Increased AFP  Trisomies? Decreased AFP + Estriol Down syndrome (trisomy 21) and Edwards syndrome (trisomy 18) are associated with low AFP levels    Until you turn 18, can't drink == no fun, only decreases  Age 21? Only increases, great for inhibitin' A + beta-HCG  Gestational age based on menstrual period (ie, dating-error) is the most common reason for an abnormal alpha-fetoprotein lvl  Pts w irregular menses == anovulatory cycles == interfering w accurate dating = US needed to determine
