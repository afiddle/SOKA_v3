# Answer
Tretinoin's MOA: binding to its receptor == activation of the nuclear gene transcription of collagen mRNA, nucleus of fibroblasts  Tretinoin and other retinoids bind transcription factors in the nucleus called retinoic acid receptors.   In the case of the dermal fibroblast, binding of these factors increases transcription of collagen mRNA.
