# Question
How do you work up anatomical causes of infertility?     **Hysterosalpingogram**

---

# Answer
A hysterosalpingogram = evaluates the structure of the uterine cavity and the patency of the fallopian tubes with fluoroscopy.    This confirms normal fallopian tube patency = regular contour of the uterine cavity, narrow linear contrast stripes extending from the uterus (fallopian tubes), and spillage of the contrast into the peritoneal cavity.    looking for stuff like fibroids, strictures, PID salph = fallopian tubes arrows and R = normal spillage of contrast
