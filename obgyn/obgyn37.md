# Question
--- Do with heme ---     Type II Hypersensitivity Disorders - Cytotoxic:   Transfusion Reaction  - Antibody against **ABO blood glycoproteins**  - IgM isohemagglutinins formed naturally in response to bacterial flora cause opsonization and complement activation  - Leads to hemolysis    **Hemolytic Disease of the Newborn (Erythroblastosis fetalis)   Antibody = **Anti-RhD+ IgG**  - Formed in **Rh-** mother carrying **Rh+** child  - First pregnancy **sensitizes** (doesn't have to be viable pregnancy)   - Antibody crosses placenta and injures subsequent fetuses  - Prevent with **RhoGAM** (anti-Rh, binds fetal red cells and prevents mothers immune system from reacting)         ABO blood typing and screening for other preformed Abs; always done in case of transplants.   Universal donor: type **O**   Universal recipient: type **AB**    (Ex) Type A can donate to **type A** and **type AB**. Type A can receive donations from **type A** and **type O**.   - Anti-B antibodies prevent donation from type B and type AB.        HLA Typing - Microcytotoxicity test   Tests for MHC **class I (HLA-A, HLA-B)**   Test hundreds of different haplotypes to find a potential match.    Cells recognized by antibody will be attacked by complement and thus become leaky and take up dye.         HLA Typing - Mixed lymphocyte reaction   Tests for MHC class **II (HLA-DR)**   Take donor cells and irradiate them (prevent proliferation). Irradiated cells are mixed with donor cells to see if proliferation occurs.     Higher radioactivity (thymidine) signifies **lower** compatibility.
