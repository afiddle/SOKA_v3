# Question
How does the [TF]urea (=concentration of urea in the tubular fluid) change in the cortical and outer medullary collecting ducts *ADH present*?    **Increased [TF]urea**

---

# Answer
due to reabsorption of H2O w/o urea; ADH present, water reabsorption promotion from the CDs, leaving urea behind *TF* == increased [TF]urea, which contributes to establishing the medullary osmotic gradient and  urine [] when needed to conserve H2O.
