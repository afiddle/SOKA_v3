# Answer
"NephrOtic MNEMONIC: ""Diabetic Amy reMembers with Minimal Focus""  3 cells compose the filtration barrier:  - endothelial (inner),  - basement membrane (between the former and the latter), and  - podocytes (outer layer of glomerular capillaries).  MN = podocytes' surface, where phospholipase A2 receptors are located = autoAb against PLA2R == podocyte injury"
