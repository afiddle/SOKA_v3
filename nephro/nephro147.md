# Answer
Ureteral obstruction 'n' vesicoureteral reflux are common urinary tract complications.   - Chronic reflux == hydroureter and hydronephrosis = dilation of the renal pelvis and calyces == compression atrophy of the renal parenchyma and eventual renal insufficiency and failure    - Hydronephrosis can be graded in severity; most severe = compress the parenchyma == gross distortion of renal architecture.
