# Question
Renal excretion of a drug is dependent on 3 factors that reduce renal drug excretion and lead to increased plasma drug levels:  Reduced **glomerular** filtration ~ low RBF, CKD, and high drug protein binding  Reduced **renal tubular** secretion ~ coadm of overlapping drugs   Increased **tubular** reabsorption ~ urine pH (depends on the drug being acidic, eg.)

# Answer
therefore, dec renal tubular secretion == dec urinary excretion rate
