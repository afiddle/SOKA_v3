# Question
In prerenal azotemia, there is an **increase** in the ratio of BUN/creatinine to >20:1

---

# Answer
b/c BUN is reabsorbed and creatinine is not; reabsorption increases with hypovolemia aka hypovolemic shock  Net effect = rapid BP increase (aim: maintain tissue perfusion) + kidney increase in Na+, Urea, and H2O reabsorption (aim: restore circulatory volume)   Increased urea reabsorption, mediated by ADH == increases urea permeability *inner medullary CDs* == accentuates medullary [] gradient == maximizing free H2O retention.  Serum: - elevated Urea(s) and - elevated BUN/creatinine ratio (>20:1).   Urine parameters: - low u[Na+] (<20 mEq/L), - low fractional excretion of Na+, and - high (u)osmolality (>450 mOsmol/kg), and - elevated uK+.
