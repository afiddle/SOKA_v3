# Question
What complication arises more often in the left testis than the right due to its venous drainage to the left renal vein before the IVC?    **Varicocele**

# Answer
left spermatic vein enters the left renal vein at a 90 degree angle, therefore venous pressure is increased; right spermatic vein drains directly into IVC
