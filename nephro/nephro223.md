# Answer
The cause of posterior urethra obstruction is a persistent urogenital membrane == incomplete canalization == PUVs  - Bladder distension with an inc contractile force required to overcome the obstruction == detrusor mm hypertrophy and bladder wall thickening  - Bilateral secondary vesicoureteral reflux ~higher P *bladder* relative to the ureters and hydronephrosis due to retrograde urine flow
