# Question
**Renal tubular acidosis** is a group of disorders of the renal tubules that lead to normal anion gap (hyperchloremic) metabolic acidosis

---

# Answer
RTA == hyperchloremic, non-anion gap metacid from the dysregulation of the renal tubules == loss of bicarbonate or inability to excrete hydrogen ions.  Anion Gap = Na+ − (Cl− + HCO3−​)  Low bicarbonate level, with a normal anion gap within 8-12 = non-anion gap acidosis
