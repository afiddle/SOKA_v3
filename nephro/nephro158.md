# Question
In a renal transplant a patient presenting with fever and leakage of urine into the pelvic cavity 5-10 days following the transplant most likely has **distal ureteral ischemia**

---

# Answer
- in a renal transplant, native kidney is typically left in place and donor kidney is placed retroperitoneally in right iliac fossa; blood supply is established by anastomosing donor renal artery with recipients external iliac artery        - proximal 1/3 of donor ureter is preserved and used to establish continuity from collecting system of kidney to recipients bladder; most distal part of donor kidney ureter is susceptible to ischemia due to lack of anastomotic connections
