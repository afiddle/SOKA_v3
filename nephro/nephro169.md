# Question
What would the platelet count and bleeding time show for uremia-induced platelet dysfunction?   Platelet count = **normal** Bleeding time = **prolonged**

---

# Answer
qualitative PLT disorder (uremic toxins interfere with PLT aggregation == prolonged BT). In contrast, everything that starts with P is normal = normal PLT count, normal PT, and normal aPTT   Uremic bleeding can be improved with dialysis as it removes the toxins and partially reverses the bleeding abnormality.
