# Question
What acid-base disorders are associated with aspirin (salicylate) toxicity?    Early: **pure respiratory alkalosis**   Late (>12h): **mixed respiratory alkalosis and metabolic acidosis** with **normal** pH   * Bonus: What happens to pH, HCO3-, and PaCO2 in the case of a borderline time in-between the late 'n' the early phases (ie, ~12h) of this toxicity?

# Answer
- respiratory alkalosis due to increased respiratory drive; metabolic acidosis due to increased production/decreased elimination of organic acids and anaerobic metabolism; use Winter's formula to make sure there's two coexisting primary issues. - symptoms of fever, tinnitus, tachypnea.   Compensation: in a maximally-compensated metabolic acidosis (which takes about 12-24h), Winter's formula applies:    Expected PaCO2 = (1.5 x sHCO3-) + (8 ± 2); shortcut = Expected PaCO2 = last two digits of the pH ± 2    Early: aspirin stimulates medullary respiratory center Medium: aspirin is an acid and dissociates and causes increased lipolysis + inhibits citric acid cycle, forming lactic acid and causing metabolic acidosis.   The PaCO2 will be lower than the predicted respiratory compensation by Winter's formula due to concurrent respiratory alkalosis.
