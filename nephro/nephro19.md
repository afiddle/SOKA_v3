# Question
In the absence of ADH, the corticopapillary osmotic gradient is **smaller::smaller or larger**

---

# Answer
due to less urea cycling and countercurrent multiplication; in dehydration scenarios (high ADH), the medullary collecting ducts can use urea absorption to help maintain hydration homeostasis  The higher the need, the greater the gradients; The lesser the need (well-hydrated state), the smaller the gradients
