# Question
In **nephrotic** syndrome, the **charge** barrier of the glomerular filtration barrier is lost

---

# Answer
== albuminuria, hypoproteinemia, generalized edema, and hyperlipidemia   - incd glomerular capillary permeability == massive albumin loss *urine* aka albuminuria == compensatory increase in albumin synthesis *liver*; However, the amount of renal albumin loss exceeds its synthetic capacity - hypoalbuminemia == reduces plasma oncotic pressure == fluid shift into the interstitial space == edema - low oncotic pressure = trigger for incd lipoprotein production *liver* aka hyperlipidemia
