# Question
What is the likely dx: elevated BUN and creatinine (< 20:1 ratio) after an episode of hypovolemic shock? There are pigmented granular casts and renal tubular epithelial cells on microscopy.   **ATN, Acute tubular necrosis**

# Answer
first event: depletion of ATP == loss of epithelial polarity = rapid cytoskeletal disruption == cascade: 1. blunting of apical microvilli = disrupts solute transport 2. loss of cell-cell adhesion (eg, tight junctions) = leakage of tubular fluid into interstitium 3. redistribution of integrins = cell detachment, tubular obstruction, and cast formation 4. redistribution of Na+-K+-ATPases = disrupting gradient[ ] for Na+ reabsorption   pigmented granular casts = muddy brown casts tubules are being damaged, so you see the tubular epithelial cells
