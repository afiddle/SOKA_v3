# Answer
subthal x hemiball  disruption in the indirect basal ganglia overstimulates the direct basal ganglia, producing excess muscle movement; contralateral lesion   Lesions to the subthalamus leads to contralateral hemiballismus (eg, R subthalamic nucleus lesion == L-sided hemiballismus)  Subthalamus = modulates basal ganglia output = mediates control of voluntary movements
