# Question
**Fomepizole** is used as an antidote for **methanol** or **ethylene glycol** poisoning by alcohol dehydrogenase inhibition

# Answer
- methanol â†’ formic acid = toxic metabolite to damage the retina/optic nerve == visual disturbances, retinal edema, optic disc hyperemia, GI distress, putaminal hemorrhage, and neurologic depression - competitive inhibition (eg, fomepizole) = when an inhibitor binds to an enzyme (at the active site) preventing it from binding the substrate = increases Km without altering Vmax.
