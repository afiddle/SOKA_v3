# Question
The most common type of Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT1A)  is a duplication of large region of 17p which results in a mutation of **PMP22**  * Bonus: symptoms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT)?

# Answer
- PMP22, mainly expressed in schwann cells of PNS, plays an essential role in formation and maintenance of compact myelin   - this disrupts molecular signals that regulate survival and differentiation between schwann cells and neurons == constant cycle of demyelination and remyelination
