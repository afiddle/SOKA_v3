---

# Answer
A comes before E in the alphabet as 'g' does for 'v', and as 9 (CN IX) comes before 10 (CN X)  Somatic afferent fibers of CN IX = palation and upper pharynx sensation == Afferent gag reflex info  Efferent nerve of the gag reflex = CN X = vagus nerve innervates the soft palate and pharyngeal muschles to control gagging and swallowing
