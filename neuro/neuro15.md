# Answer
During a >3d fasting state, the brain is dependent upon ketone bodies as its primary source of energy.   Beta-oxidation, which requires the carnitine-acylcarnitine cycle to transfer acyl groups from the cytoplasm to the matrix, allows for the production of ketone bodies = laboratory evaluation of hypoglycemia, metabolic acidosis, and ketonuria
