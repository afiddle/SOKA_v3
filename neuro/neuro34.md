# Question
Lesions to CN **VIII (vestibulocochlear)** may cause sensorineural hearing loss and loss of balance

---

# Answer
Damage to the 8th nerve == spontaneous nystagmus; It conveys head position and movement involved in the vestibuloocular reflex (VOR), which stabilizes the gaze during head movement  CN VIII = 8 = hearing (dorsal 'n' ventral cochlear nuclei) and head position and movement (vestribular nuclei)
