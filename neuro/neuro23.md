# Answer
"dorsal columns are: ""VIP that deserve a very important fine touch on their back""   ==  dorsal columns, which convey vibration and proprioception sensation as well as fine touch (ie, 2-point discrimination).    gracile fasciculus = medial = lower half of the body, info from spinal cord below T6 to the respective (gracile) nucleus *medulla*"
