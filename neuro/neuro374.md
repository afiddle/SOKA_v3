# Question

The **precentral gyrus in the frontal lobe**, controlling voluntary movement of contralateral body parts; its lateral aspect governs movement of the contralateral face.

# Answer
UMN upper motor neuron pathology typically == contralateral lower face weakness, while the forehead musculature is spared due to dual innervation from both hemispheres.
