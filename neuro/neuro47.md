# Answer
Damage to the 8th nerve == spontaneous nystagmus; It conveys head position and movement involved in the vestibuloocular reflex (VOR), which stabilizes the gaze during head movement  CN VIII = 8 = hearing (dorsal 'n' ventral cochlear nuclei) and head position and movement (vestribular nuclei)
