# Question
Cranial nerve **VIII** is the **vestibulocochlear** nerve

---

# Answer
CN VIII = 8 = hearing (dorsal 'n' ventral cochlear nuclei) and head position and movement (vestribular nuclei)  Damage to the 8th nerve == spontaneous nystagmus; It conveys head position and movement involved in the vestibuloocular reflex (VOR), which stabilizes the gaze during head movement
