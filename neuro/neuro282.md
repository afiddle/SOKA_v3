# Answer
Intellectual disability, downward lens dislocation, and thrombosis are unique to homocystinuria   - due to cystathione synthase deficiency or methionine synthase deficiency == inability to form cysteine from homocysteine - cysteine becomes essential in patients, and homocysteine buildup == elevated methionine == premature thromboembolic events ~homocysteine is prothrombotic (eg, atherosclerosis, acute coronary syndrome)
