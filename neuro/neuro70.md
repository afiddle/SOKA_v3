# Answer
crus cerebri is the anterior portion of the cerebral peduncle which contains the motor tracts  Named after John Kernohan, a neuropathologist who first described this anatomical phenomenon in the 1920s. Kernohan notch = compression or displacement of the contralateral cerebral peduncle (specifically, the motor fibers within the crus cerebri)
