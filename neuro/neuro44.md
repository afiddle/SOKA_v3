# Answer
innervates the pupillary sphincter muscle and the ciliary muscle    pupillary asymmetry = anisocoria = THE SMALLER, THE AFFECTED   can be symp x parasymp   anisocoria exists, then we ask the question:   *DARK LIGHT* is there still a BIG difference? Can I still say there's an asymmetry or is it difficult to say so?    Sim = oculosympathetic defect = YES, there's an asymmetry o O   No = parasymp defect = O O (not so obvious asymmetry)
