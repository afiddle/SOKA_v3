# Question
Which cranial nerve provides somatosensation to the posterior 1/3rd and the tonsillar lining of the tongue?    **Glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX)**

# Answer
Somatic afferent fibers of CN IX = palation and upper pharynx sensation == Afferent gag reflex info   - Somatic motor: Stylopharyngeus mm only = elevates larynx *swallowing*   - Parasympathetic: Inferior salivatory nucleus → CN IX → otic ganglion → travels along auriculotemporal nerve (CN V3) → parotid gland secretion   - General sensory:  Tympanic membrane (inner surface), eustachian tube, posterior 1/3 of tongue, tonsillar region, upper pharynx (afferent portion of gag reflex), carotid body, and carotid sinus   - Special sensory (taste):  Posterior 1/3 of tongue   A comes before E in the alphabet as 'g' does for 'v', and as 9 (CN IX) comes before 10 (CN X)
