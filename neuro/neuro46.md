# Answer
CN VIII = 8 = hearing (dorsal 'n' ventral cochlear nuclei) and head position and movement (vestibular nuclei) 7 = CN VII = facial motor nuclei = facial expression mm 6 = CN VI = abducens motor nuclei = lateral rectus mm 5 = CN V = motor (mm of mastication) and sensory nuclei (to the face and jaw)  8th nerve conveys head position and movement involved in the vestibuloocular reflex (VOR), which stabilizes the gaze during head movement. Damage == spontaneous nystagmus
