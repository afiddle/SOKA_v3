# Question
During a Rinne test:   Air louder than bone = **sensorineural (or normal)::sensorineural or normal/conductive** deficit Bone louder than air = **conductive::sensorineural/conductive** deficit

# Answer
better at mastoid? abnormal Rinne test = conductive hearing loss (= impaired transmission of air vibrations to the inner ear)    sensorineural or normal: normally when you remove from bone, air transmits better = can still hear conductive: when you remove from bone, there is a blockage (conductive block) = cannot hear.
