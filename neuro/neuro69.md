# Question
Uncal herniation involves displacement of the temporal lobe uncus under the **tentorium cerebelli** == CN III compression = ipsilateral fixed 'n' dilated pupil

---

# Answer
- Uncal herniation of the medial temporal lobe (ie, uncus) through the tentorial notch == CN III compression = ipsilateral fixed 'n' dilated pupil X- or ipsilateral hemiparesis and x-lateral homonymous hemianopsia with macular sparing may also occur.  - Subfalcine herniation of the cingulate gyrus under the falx cerebri - Tonsillar herniation of the cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum
