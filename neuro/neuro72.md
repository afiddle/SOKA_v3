# Answer
- quadriplegia 'n' loss of speech ~ destruction of the cortical spinal 'n' cortical bulbar pathways - preserved vertical (but not horizontal) eye movements and eyelid elevation ~ spared rostral midbrain control - preserved consciousness ~ spared midbrain reticular formation  - preserved sensation ~ unaffected sensory pathways, spared brainstem 'n' spinal reflexes, since they don't require cortical input  == lesions of the pons, medulla, lower midbrain, corticospinal and corticobulbar tracts, ocular CN nuclei, PPRF
