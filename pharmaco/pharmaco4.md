# Question
Prolactin secretion is stimulated via **thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH)** from the hypothalamus; lactotroph cells have TRH-receptors

# Answer
Prolactin production = regulated by inhibitory effects of hypothalamic dopaminergic pathways.  However, secretion = stimulated by TRH, ie., thyrotropin-releasing hormone. In 1ry hypothyroidism, the more TRH production *hypothalamus* == the more prolactin == hyperprolactinemia.
