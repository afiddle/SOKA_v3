# Question
Which enzyme is responsible for mature HIV virion formation from a large polypeptide?   **Aspartate protease**

---

# Answer
HIV encodes an aspartate protease via its pol gene  - Immature viruses (ie, lacking a mature core) indicate that a protease inhibitor is to that function specific  HIV attaches to CD4 cells, enters via fusion, reverse transcribes its genome which is then integrated into the lymphocyte genome, and  - Hijacks cellular machinery to produce new viral particles that require protease activity to become fully mature. Protease inhibitors block this last step.  - Protease inhibitors allow for the preceding steps of viral replication but block the formation of a mature viral core from immature precursors.
