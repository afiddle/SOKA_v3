# Question
Isoniazid can cause hepatotoxicity, which manifests as mild hepatic dysfunction or acute **hepatitis aka drug-induced liver injury**

---

# Answer
This drug-induced hepatitis = panlobular mononuclear infiltration and hepatic cell necrosis on liver biopsy  Frank hepatitis (fever, anorexia, and nausea, sometimes progressing to hepatic failure) in a small percentage of patients   Isoniazid-induced idiosyncratic liver injury with a histological picture similar to viral hepatitis must be considered   Although extrahepatic hypersensitivity manifestations like rash, arthralgias, fever, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia are common in patients with drug-induced liver injury, they are characteristically absent in cases of isoniazid-induced hepatic cell injury
