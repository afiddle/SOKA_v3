# Answer
"pendrin chloride/BICArbonate exchanger ~ Cl- and HCO- flow interchangibly in 'n' out of the body = if HCO3- flows to the bloodstream, chloride excretion via urine; alternatively, bica to the urine (if HCO3- high lvls, eg.), Cl- reabsorption flow to serum  # hypochloremia setting: too Cl- being excreted == HCO3- is reabsorbed == serum becomes more basic == more metalkal"
