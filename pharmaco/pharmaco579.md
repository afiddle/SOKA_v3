# Question
**Beta-oxidation of fatty** acids, the **TCA citric acid cycle**, and the **carboxylation of pyruvate (gluconeogenesis)** all occur within the mitochondria.

---

# Answer
Pyruvate carboxylase catalyzes the initial step in gluconeogenesis by converting pyruvate to oxaloacetate. This enzyme requires biotin as a cofactor, and functions within the mitochondria  Succinate dehydrogenase = TCA cycle enzyme that converts succinate to fumarate. It is an inner mitochondrial membrane protein and functions as part of the electron transport chain.  Ornithine transcarbamylase catalyzes the combination of ornithine and carbamoyl phosphate to form citrulline in the urea cycle. This reaction occurs within the mitochondria.  3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG CoA) lyase = mitochondrial enzyme necessary for ketogenesis. It is also responsible for metabolism of the ketogenic amino acid, leucine.
