# Question
In **first** order kinetics, the rate of reaction is directly proportional to the substrate (drug) concentration   A constant, fixed fraction (or proportion) of drug is metabolized per unit of time, so the amount metabolized changes based on the serum concentration   * Bonus: What's the difference comparing to another order of drug metabolism?

# Answer
i.e. the substrate is the limiting reagent
