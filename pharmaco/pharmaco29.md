# Question
Do reversible competitive inhibitors bind to the active site of the enzyme?   **Yes**

---

# Answer
Competitive inhibitors compete with substrate for active binding sites on enzymes.      Additional substrate is required to achieve the same rate of reaction == increasing the measured value of the Michaelis constant (Km).      Competitive inhibitors DO NOT affect enzyme function; therefore, maximal velocity (Vmax) is unchanged in their presence.
