# Question
The main acute side effect of Tisagenlecleucel, tx of ALL, is **Cytokine Release Syndrome** while a long term risk is the potential for **insertional mutagenesis**

---

# Answer
- the main symptoms of cytokine storm are a high fever, extreme fatigue, nausea; potential to be fatal; also occurs in GVHD, ARDS, Sepsis - because Tisagenlecleucel is generated by using a retrovirus, concerns that it could modify a protoconcogene / tumor suppressor are warranted
