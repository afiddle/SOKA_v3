# Answer
Trisomies? Decreased AFP + Estriol    Until you turn 18, can't drink == no fun, only decreases  Age 21? Only increases, great for inhibitin' A + beta-HCG   Trisomy 21 is higher than 18 = marked by Increases = Increased beta-HCG + Inhibin A  Trisomy 21 is the only one with an Increased Inhibin A  Trisomy 18 is smaller than 21 = marked by Decreases = Decreased beta-HCG     To help differentiate trisomy 18 from 21:  - 21 is marked by increases: Increased Inhibin A, as well as with an Increased beta-HCG  - 18, marked by decreases: Decreased beta-HCG + normal inhibin A   - Beta-HCG and Inhibin A levels differentiate trisomies, which share decreased AFP + Estriol
