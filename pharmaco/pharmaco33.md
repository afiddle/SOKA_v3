# Question
In response to respiratory alkalosis (e.g. due to high altitude), there is increased renal excretion of **HCO3-**

# Answer
may augment with a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor such as acetazolamide; these drugs increase HCO3- excretion by the kidneys to help relieve the alkalemia and treat the illness, creating a mild compensatory metabolic acidosis   In response to pH reduction by metabolic acidosis, there's increased ventilation to increase CO2 exhalation (ie, compensatory respiratory alkalosis)
