# Question
Breast cancer that is estrogen-receptor ER+ and PR+ is most likely to respond to anti-**estrogenic** agents such as **tamoxifen**

---

# Answer
Tamoxifen = selective estrogen receptor antagonist / modulator; tx = ER+ breast CA = is a prodrug metabolized by CYP2D to its active metabolite, endoxifen.  In the breast, estrogen receptor antagonist == competitive inhibition of estradiol binding to its receptor  Pts w genetic polymorphisms = poor CYP2D activity = dec lvls of the active metabolite = higher risk of relapse
