# Question
When using a(n) **reversible competitive** inhibitor, the **Km** changes, while the **Vmax** remains the same

---

# Answer
"""Lines Cross = Competitive""     Competitive inhibitors compete with substrate for active binding sites on enzymes.      Additional substrate is required to achieve the same rate of reaction == increasing the measured value of the Michaelis constant (Km).      Competitive inhibitors DO NOT affect enzyme function; therefore, maximal velocity (Vmax) is unchanged in their presence."
