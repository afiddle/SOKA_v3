# Answer
"- black urine color when exposed to air, a blue-black pigmentation on the face (ie, ""ochronosis""), and ochronotic arthropathy usually during adulthood  - Alkaptonuria = autorecess = lack of homogentisic acid dioxygenase blocks the metabolism of tyrosine, leading to an accumulation of homogentisic acid"
