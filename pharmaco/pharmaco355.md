# Question
The Ubiquitin-proteasome system is recruited in response to **damaged** proteins as a result of cellular stress

---

# Answer
"- This could also include misfolded / old or ""done"". Here, ""done"" means that the protein has completed its task = major eukaryotic mechanism for selective proteolysis  cancer-related cachexia, a hypermetabolic state w high pro-inflammatory cytokines == increased ubiquitination of sarcomeric mm proteins == extensive skeletal mm loss    misfolded protein targeted for the proteasome, eg, misfolded CFTR protein in cystic fybrosis"
