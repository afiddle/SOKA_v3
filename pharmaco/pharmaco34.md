# Question
Compared to disorders of galactose metabolism, disorders of fructose metabolism are more **mild::severity**

---

# Answer
Dietary fructose = phosphorylated *liver* to F1P == rapidly metabolized b/c it bypasses PFK-1, the major rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis.    Other sugars (eg, glucose, galactose, mannose) enter glycolysis prior to PFK-1 == more slowly metabolized.
