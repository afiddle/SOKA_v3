Amino acids = amino group, carboxyl group, and non-/polar, acidic/basic side chains  **Ala Alanine, Gly Glycine, Ile Isoleucine, Leu Leucine, Met Methionine, Phe Phenylalanine, Pro Proline, Trp Tryptophan, Val Valine** = Nonpolar  **Asn Asparagine, Cys Cysteine, Gln Glutamine, Ser Serine, Thr Threonine, Tyr Tyrosine** = Polar  **Asp Aspartate and Glu Glutamate::2** = Acidic **Arg Arginine, His Histidine, Lys Lysine::3** = Basic
