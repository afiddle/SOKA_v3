# Question
Beta oxydation of fatty acids: *mytochondria* **malonyl CoA** inhibits carnitine acyltransferase-1 == prevents the breakdown of newly synthesized fatty acids

---

# Answer
Beta-oxidation *mitochondrial matrix* whose membrane is impermeable to fatty acids Acetyl-CoA is converted to malonyl-CoA by acetyl-CoA carboxylase = rate-limiting step of de novo fatty acid synthesis Carnitine is essential for the transport of fatty acids through the mitochondrial membrane; it's necessary for fatty acid oxidation Carnitine = fatty acids' carrier through the 'impermeable' membrane  Malonyl-CoA inhibits the action of mitochondrial carnitine acyltransferase == inhibiting beta-oxidation (ie, the breakdown) of newly formed fatty acids   Beta-oxidation of fatty acids takes place primarily within the mitochondrial matrix. Mitochondrial membranes are impermeable to fatty acids due to their negative charge, so a specialized membrane carrier (carnitine) must be used to shuttle them into the matrix.     Malonyl-CoA inhibits carnitine acyltransferase, preventing the transfer of acyl groups into the mitochondria.  This inhibitory action functions to prevent the breakdown of newly synthesized fatty acids.
