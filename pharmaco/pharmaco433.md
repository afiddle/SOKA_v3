# Question
Which HAART (ie, Highly Active AntiRetroviral Therapy) drugs prevent mature virion formation from large polypeptides?   **Protease inhibitors -navir suffix**

---

# Answer
recall that viruses produce a large polypeptide that must be cleaved into smaller peptides for viral virion formation   Immature viruses (ie, lacking a mature core) indicate that a protease inhibitor is to that function specific   HIV attaches to CD4 cells, enters via fusion, reverse transcribes its genome which is then integrated into the lymphocyte genome, and - Hijacks cellular machinery to produce new viral particles that require protease activity to become fully mature. Protease inhibitors block this last step. - Protease inhibitors allow for the preceding steps of viral replication but block the formation of a mature viral core from immature precursors.
