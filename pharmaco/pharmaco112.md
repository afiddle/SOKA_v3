# Question
Acetyl-CoA is converted to **malonyl-CoA** via the cytosolic enzyme **acetyl-CoA carboxylase::upregulated by high citrate and high insulin in the well-fed state caused by high carbohydrate intake** (fatty acid synthesis and beta-oxidation)

# Answer
Beta-oxidation *mitochondrial matrix* Acetyl-CoA is converted to malonyl-CoA by acetyl-CoA carboxylase = rate-limiting step of de novo fatty acid synthesis Carnitine is essential for the transport of fatty acids through the mitochondrial membrane; it's necessary for fatty acid oxidation Malonyl-CoA inhibits the action of mitochondrial carnitine acyltransferase == inhibiting beta-oxidation (ie, the breakdown) of newly formed fatty acids
