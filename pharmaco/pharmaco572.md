# Question
C) Arteriolar peripheral resistance is the site of action for **dihydropyridine (DHP) calcium-channel blockers CCBs::eg, amlodipine and nifedipine**, which exert their antihypertensive effect by inhibiting calcium influx into vascular smooth mm cells == dec peripheral arteriolar resistance == potent arteriolar vasodilation

# Answer
Peripheral edema = common AE = 25% incidence after 6mo of Dihydropyridine (DHP) CCBs   The edema = related to dilation of precapillary vessels (arteriolar dilation) == inc capillary hydrostatic pressure and fluid extravasation into the interstitium.    DHP CCBs = potent arteriolar dilators == more peripheral edema x non-dihydropyridine CCBs (eg, diltiazem, verapamil).    AE of DHP CCBs = gingival hyperplasia; peripheral edema, lightheadedness, headache, facial flushing, and dizziness.   In contrast with nondihydropyridine CCBs, these CCBs have minimal activity on cardiomyocytes   RAAS antagonists (=ACE inhibitors or ARBs) == post-capillary venodilation, normalizing the inc capillary hydrostatic pressure and thereby preventing the peripheral edema
