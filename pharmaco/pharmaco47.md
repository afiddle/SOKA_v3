# Question
1st generation H1 receptor antagonists, especially **diphenhydramine**, may be used as a(n) **sleep** aid   * Bonus: What are their anticholinergic effects and the mnemonic to remember them?

# Answer
nonspecific, 1st generation H1 receptor blockers act as antagonist to multiple receptors (eg, muscarinic ACh receptor) == anticholinergic effects (eg, fever, urinary retention, decreased sweating, altered mental status)
