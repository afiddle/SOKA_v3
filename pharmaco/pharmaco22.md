# Question
In **zero** order kinetics, the rate of reaction is constant, and a fixed amount of drug is metabolized per unit time, **independent** of serum levels

---

# Answer
i.e. the amount of enzyme is the limiting reagent (saturation)     In contrast, in first-order kinetics = a constant, fixed fraction (or proportion) of drug is metabolized per unit of ime, so the amount metabolized changes based on the serum concentration
