# Question
Metabolic compensation in response to respiratory acidosis or alkalosis is **delayed::timing**

---

# Answer
thus, acute respiratory acid-base disturbances are not well compensated   In response to pH reduction by metabolic acidosis, there's increased ventilation to increase CO2 exhalation (ie, compensatory respiratory alkalosis)
