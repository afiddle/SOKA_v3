# Answer
"macrolides or tetracyclines = bacterial protein synthesis inhibitors, since these organisms completely lack a cell wall = no Gram stain = peptidoglycan-targeting antibacterials do not work  - Chlamydia or Mycoplasma = low fever, sore throat, persistent cough, and X-ray w bilateral patchy infiltrate = ""walking"" pneumonia = atypical CAP  - Legionella = GI symptoms, high fever, and lobar infiltrate in X-ray"
