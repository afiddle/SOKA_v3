# Answer
"increased metabolic demand... - inc minute ventilation == inc RR, facilitates +O2(in) 'n' -CO(out)  - inc tidal volume = ""volume da marÃ©"" = >50x vs rest - inc alveolar ventilation >20x vs rest >> blood flow (inc of 8x vs rest) == inc V/Q ratio - lactic acid accum == lowers blood pH == right-shift HbO2 curve == inc unloading of O2 to mm (they have the highest demand) so there'll be an inc fractional extraction of arterial O2 == mixed vv O2 content WILL BE DECREASED"
