# Question
The pulmonary circulation is normally characterized as a **low** resistance, **high** compliance system (low or high)

# Answer
The lungs contain a dual circulatory supply from the pulmonary and the bronchial circulations.   From the pulmonary trunk, the pulmonary circulation = low-pressure system = gas exchange with the alveoli == return of oxygenated blood from the systemic venous circulation to the LA.  From an intercostal artery (right side), and from the Ao (left), the bronchial circulation, a high P system, perfuses the bronchi, lung parenchyma, and visceral pleura.  The right broncial a. == collateral arterial flow to the right upper lobe
