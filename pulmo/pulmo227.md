# Question
Tetralogy of Fallot can present in infancy with episodic cyanosis and poor weight gain.   **RVOT (RV outflow tract)::cardiologic abnormality** obstruction == underperfusion of pulmonary aa == chronic hypoxemia, leading to **secondary polycythemia (=inc Ht)::myeloproliferative disorder**  * Bonus: Why is this the most common mechanism of **polycythemia::myeloproliferative disorder** overall?

# Answer
* The body wouldn't accept a chronic life w/o proper oxygen.  In response to chronic hypoxemia == more RBCs to increase oxygen-binding capacity.  Tissue hypoxia *kidney inner cortex 'n' medulla* == renal production of EPO erythropoietin == bone marrow is stimulated to produce more RBCs == inc [Hb] 'n' Ht = polycythemia
