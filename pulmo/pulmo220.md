# Question
**pulmonary capillary wedge pressure** = 6-12 mm Hg = PCWP translates **LA pressure** and therefore indicates **severe LV failure or MS** if increased

---

# Answer
wedge = barreira, aka, pulmonary artery occlusion pressure  ARDS (below) = hypoxia and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and associated with pneumonia, sepsis, trauma, and pancreatitis == noncardiogenic pulmonary edema ~inc pulmonary capillary permeability + normal PCWP   Incd PCWP + peripheral edema + JVD == cardiogenic source of pulmonary edema
