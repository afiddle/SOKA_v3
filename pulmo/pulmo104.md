# Question
What type of V/Q mismatch may occur in patients with severe pneumonia?   **Right-to-left intrapulmonary shunt::elevated Aa gradient**

---

# Answer
- shunted deoxygenated blood due to lack of alveolar ventilation (they're filled with junk) â†’ hypoxemia that cannot be corrected by oxygen   reasoning:  - adding 100 will improve right side but left side is still < 99% and they will eventually mix, causing hypoxemia - compare with V/Q mismatch (e.g. 2/2 PE or COPD), which does improve with oxygen 100% - there isn't mixing with the deoxygenated blood on the left side.
