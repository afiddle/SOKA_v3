# Question
The lungs exert collapsing force, and the resting chest wall exerts expanding force.  A pneumothorax, and loss of **intrapleural negative pressure**, causes the chest wall to enlarge the hemithorax. Similarly, the lung collapses to its equilibrium position where **inspiratory compliance** is decreased.  After a large pneumothorax, air fills in the intrapleural space and the cavity; Thus, hemithorax volume increases

# Answer
Opposing forces in equilibrium == sustained intrapleural negative pressure = allows lung and chest wall to move together as a combined respiratory unit Intrapleural pressure at the end of max. inspiration = -8cmH2O (point of intersection below)
