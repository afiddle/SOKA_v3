# Question
Levels of **angiotensin II (ATII)** are higher in the pulmonary vein (on the way out of the lungs) than in the pulmonary artery (on the way into the lungs).

# Answer
Angiotensin II = potent vasoconstrictor = produced from ATI by ACE *pulmonary vasculature*  The reduced CO in chro HF leads to decreased renal perfusion and consequent stimulation of the RAAS in a maladaptive effort to maintain effective blood volume.  Inactive angiotensin I is converted into active ATII by endothelial-bound angiotensin-converting enzyme *lungs*.
