# Answer
High altitute = risk factor for hypovolemia == orthostatic hypotension; presentation: headache, fatigue, dizziness, nausea, palpitations, insomnia   Standing up/postural change → insufficient counterregulation due to autonomic dysfunction (eg, decreased carotid sinus baroreceptor activity) and hypovolemia with decreased venous return → reduced cerebral perfusion
