# Question
During which phase of the natural history of lobar pneumonia is the exudate composed of bacteria mostly?   **Congestion within first two days**   * Bonus: Describe the characteristic inflammatory response step-wisely.

# Answer
Congestion = 0-2d = neutrophils release cytokines == increased pulmonary capillary permeability to facilitate cell migration, but also causing RBC accumulation & abundant proteinaceious fluid *alveoli*  Red hepatization = 2-4d = proteinaceous fluid transformation into fibrin == exudate of fibrin, neutrophils, and RBCs = liver-like lobe on gross path = red, firm, and airless  Gray hepatization = 4-7d = RBC disintegration and inc leukocyte infiltration == gray lung; Neutrophil replacement by macrophages to begin repair  Resolution >7d = macrophages secrete digestive enzymes == liquefying the fibrinous exudate to be reabsorbed, expectorated, or phagocytized by 'em; Lung normal appearance ~3w
