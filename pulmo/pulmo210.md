# Question
PE presents with hypoxemia due to **high** V/Q mismatch and respiratory alkalosis or hypocapnia due to hyperventilation, translated by a **high** pH, a **low** PaCO2, and a **metabolic** compensation with **renal HCO3- loss >72 hours after onset**.

# Answer
The combination of calf swelling, history of prolonged immobility, and sudden-onset dyspnea is strongly suggestive of acute pulmonary embolism (PE)  The serum HCO3- is near normal in the acute setting, but metabolic compensation with renal bicarbonate loss takes place over the next 72 hours.
