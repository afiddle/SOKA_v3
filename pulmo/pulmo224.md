# Question
A 30yo-F on an airplane (barometric P = 565 mmHg). The Alveolar gas equation calculates the **inspiratory partial pressure of alveolar oxygen::PiO2** at a given Patm:   PiO2 (mm Hg) = FiO2 × (Patm – PH2O)   Where FiO2 = **fraction of inspired oxygen** = 21% or 0.21 (unchanged at modest altitude) Patm = **atmospheric P**, and  PH2O = **partial P of H2O vapor** = 47 mm Hg (also unchanged)

# Answer
Inserted into the equation, PiO2 = 0.21 × (565 mm Hg – 47 mm Hg) = 109 mm Hg.  This represents the partial pressure of oxygen that is inspired by the young woman within the pressurized cabin.
