# Question
Red dot on the lung P-V curve represents the resting equilibrium of the respiratory system (ie, **end-tidal expiration**). What is the intrapleural P?  **-5 cm H2O::intrapleural P is always negative**    * Bonus: Why does the intrapleural P has this value at the point of resting equilibrium?

# Answer
The point where the collapsing force of the lungs = expanding force of the chest wall is the resting equilibrium of the respiratory system. The alveolar P at this point is equivalent to atmospheric P = 0 cm H2O, and the lung volume is the FRC functional residual capacity
