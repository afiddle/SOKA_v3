# Question
In ARDS and lobar pneumonia, leakage of protein-rich fluid within alveolar airspaces leads to noncardiogenic pulmonary **edema::due to increased pulmonary capillary permeability** while maintaing a normal PCWP

# Answer
ARDS = hypoxia and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates = pneumonia, sepsis, trauma, and pancreatitis == noncardiogenic pulmonary edema ~ inc pulmonary capillary permeability + normal PCWP  Whereas, Incd PCWP + peripheral edema + JVD == cardiogenic source of pulmonary edema
