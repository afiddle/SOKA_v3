# Question
The reduction of respiratory compliance in obesity, a restrictive lung disease, is in part due to a reduction in **chest wall** compliance, due to increased weight

# Answer
marked by dec ERV expiratory reserve volume; a restrictive lung disease w/ rapid-shallow breathing; thus FRC is reduced as well; FEV1, FVC, and TLC are also typically decreased, but obesity has a minimal effect on RV reserve volume
