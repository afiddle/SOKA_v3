# Question
**Case-control** studies are useful for measuring **odds ratio (OR)** = (ad) / (bc)   The null hypothesis is always equal to 1

# Answer
OR quantifies the relationship between an exposure and a disease; its null value, aka null hypothesis value, is always 1 (ie, OR = 1)    e.g. patients with COPD had higher odds of a history of smoking than those without COPD
