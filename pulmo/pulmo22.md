# Question
What type of V/Q mismatch occurs due to airway obstruction?    **Shunt (perfusion but no ventilation)::elevated A-a gradient**

# Answer
also may occur with right-to-left shunts    In the upright position, regional differences in ventilation and perfusion occur vertically in the lungs due to gravity.  Ventilation is lowest in the apex and highest in the base because gravity acts to stretch the lungs downward so that the alveoli at the apex are expanded more than those at the base (ie, slinky effect).  Therefore, during inspiration a small amount of air goes to the apex where alveoli are distended and less compliant, while more air goes to the base where alveoli have ample potential space to fill and are more compliant.  Perfusion is also lowest in the apex and highest in the base, as the increased hydrostatic pressure in the lower lung regions facilitates increased blood flow.  Because blood is denser than air or lung tissue, the gravitational effect on perfusion is more pronounced than on ventilation, leading to greater variability in perfusion than ventilation from apex to base.  Therefore, perfusion is very low in the apex and very high in the base, whereas ventilation is only somewhat low in the apex and somewhat high in the base.  This causes the gradient of the ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) ratio to be opposite of the gradient of perfusion or ventilation taken individually.  The V/Q ratio is lowest at the base and highest at the apex.
