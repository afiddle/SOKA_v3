# Question
Does hypoxemia secondary to intrapulmonary shunt correct with supplemental O2?    **No::elevated Aa gradient**

---

# Answer
important distinguishing feature of shunting x other causes of hypoxemia (e.g. focal pneumonia, pulmonary edema, atelectasis)     reasoning:  - adding 100 will improve right side but left side is still < 99% and they will eventually mix, causing hypoxemia - compare with V/Q mismatch (e.g. 2/2 PE or COPD), which does improve with oxygen 100% - there isn't mixing with the deoxygenated blood on the left side.
