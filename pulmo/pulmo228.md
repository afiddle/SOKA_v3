# Question
Cardiac point of maximal impulse palpated ***right 5th intercostal space*** in a 4yo with difficulty breathing, a productive cough and PMHx of recurrent sinusitis and OMA episodes. What's the diagnosis?  ** Kartagener syndrome::a form of primary ciliary dyskinesia** due to dysfunctional **dynein arms::molecular motor protein responsible for retrograde transport to the microtubule**

# Answer
Symptoms of PCD (eg, Kartagener syndrome) = recurrent respiratory infections (eg, chronic sinusitis, bronchiectasis) ~ impaired mucociliary clearance.    In addition, impaired ciliary movement *embryogenesis* == situs inversus (reversed right/left positioning of internal organs aka dextrocardia) + infertility (men ~impaired sperm motility 'n' women ~immobility of fallopian tube cilia)
