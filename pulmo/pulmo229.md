# Question
Intrapleural negative pressure peaks at maximal inspiration at **-8 cm H2O::value**. During passive expiration the chest wall relaxes and the respiratory system returns to its resting equilibrium position, in which intrapleural pressure is **-5 cm H2O::approximately**  * Bonus: How does this work?

# Answer
Variation in intrapleural P goes from -5 cm H2O to -8 cm H2O Resting equilibrium = end-expiration aka begin of inspiration = -5 cm H2O = minimal value
