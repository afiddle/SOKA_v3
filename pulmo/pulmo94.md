# Question
Confounding bias occurs when the exposure-disease relationship is muddled by the effect of an extraneous factor that is associated with both exposure and disease and **is NOT** on the causal pathway

---

# Answer
In summary, if in a sub-group (based on suspected confounder/effect modifier) analysis the original association between the exposure and outcome doesnâ€™t hold up in BOTH sub-groups the factor is a confounder. But if the original association holds up in one group but not in another, then the factor is an effect modifier.  - Confounder appears to have an effect on crude analysis, but upon stratification by the confounder the effect disappears    Ex.: Pulmonary disease is more common in coal workers than the general population (you could say being a coal worker increases likelihood of PD), BUT people who work in coal mines also smoke more frequently than the general population...
