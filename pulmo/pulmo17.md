# Question
What is the effect of pulmonary edema on lung compliance?   **Decreased lung compliance**

---

# Answer
Left-sided HF secondary to MI = dec contractility 'n' dec CO == elevation of EDP end-diastolic P == impairing diastolic return from the pulmonary vv == inc hydrostatic P *pulmonary capillaries* w transudation of fluid into the parenchyma == pulmonary edema  The resulting accumulation of edema in the pulmonary interstitium makes the lungs heavy and stiff restricting inspiratory expansion == decd lung compliance.
