# Question
Pneumothorax presents with **decreased** tactile fremitus and hyperresonance on the affected side; whereas an increased tactile fremitus and dullness to percussion clearly indicates pneumonia

# Answer
- increased vibrations against the examiner's hand while the Pt vocalizes diphthong phrases == increased tactile fremitus - increased density of consolidated lung tissue == less resonance = dullness to percussion
