# Question
The t(15;17) translocation seen in acute promyelocytic leukemia APML results in disruption of the **RAR retinoic acid** receptor on chromosome 17   * bonus: what's the characteristic finding on peripheral blood smear?

# Answer
multiple Auer rods = several abnormal myeloid precursors containing rod-shaped intracytoplasmic granules RAR disruption blocks maturation and promyelocytes (blasts) accumulate  The M3 variant of AML = acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) = abnormal promyelocytes on smear, typically containing abundant cytoplasmic granules, multiple Auer rods, and bilobed nuclei.  Fusion on PML gene on csms 15 'n' the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA) gene on csms 17 == PML/RARA, a chimeric gene that codes for abnormal retinoic acid repcetor, inhibiting myeloblast differentiation == promyelocytes 'n' Auer rods on smear
