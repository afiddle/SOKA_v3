# Answer
The vW factor multimers become unfolded by the high stress, leading to increased destruction by the ADAMTS13 metalloproteinase  - Acquired TTP ~ formation of autoAb inhibitor x ADAMTS-13, a vWF-cleaving protease. - Circulating vWF is released as large vWF multimers that are cleaved to their regular size by ADAMTS-13 - In TTP, the large uncleaved vWF multimers = significantly prothrombotic == diffuse microvascular thrombosis
