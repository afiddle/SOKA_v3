# Question
**ADAMSTS13::vWF metalloprotease** is an enzyme that normally cleaves vWF multimers into smaller monomers for eventual degradation

# Answer
- Acquired TTP ~ formation of autoAb inhibitor x ADAMTS-13, a vWF-cleaving protease. - Circulating vWF is released as large vWF multimers that are cleaved to their regular size by ADAMTS-13 - In TTP, the large uncleaved vWF multimers = significantly prothrombotic == diffuse microvascular thrombosis
