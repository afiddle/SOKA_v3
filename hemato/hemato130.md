# Question
BCL2 gene (ie, an antiapoptotic member) normally preserves the mitochondrial membrane integrity and impermeability, thus preventing **cytochrome c::protein** release from the inner (intrinsic) mitochondrial matrix :: apoptotic pathway   * Bonus: How can a specific translocation in BCL2 lead to follicular lymphoma?

# Answer
thus, inactivation (apoptosis) allows release of cytochrome c, which then activates caspases == cascade of proteolytic caspases enzymes   ~ BCL2 gene translocation = t(14;18) == overexpression of the apoptosis inhibitor protein (ie, BCL2 protein) == follicular lymphoma    ** BCL2 family of proteins functions as an inhibitor of the intrinsic (ie, mitochondrial) apoptotic pathway. So, BCL2 preservation of membrane integrity prevents the release of cytochrome c aka BCL2 = antiapoptotic    In contrast, overexpression of BCL2 protein due to BCL2 translocation [t(14;18) in Follicular lymphoma] leads to cytochrome c spilling out, initiating apoptosis (below, intrinsic apoptosis pathway)   intrinsic apoptosis pathway
