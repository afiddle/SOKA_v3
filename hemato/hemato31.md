# Question
Why may PTT be elevated in von Willebrand disease?    **Decreased factor VIII half-life (vWF normally stabilizes factor VIII)**

# Answer
vWF has main 2 functions = platelet plug formation & factor VIII carrier therefore, normal platelet count (there's no consumption)  normal PT (ex pathway = 7) but prolonged PTT ~ factor 8 = intrinsic pathway also prolonged bleeding time ~impaired platelet function
