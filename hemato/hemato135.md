# Question
Leukocyte adhesion deficiency, which manifests with recurrent bacterial infections, is characterized by **increased (30-150K)** circulating neutrophils

---

# Answer
due to impaired adhesion of the marginated pool of leukocytes   LFA-1 Lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 = adhesion of neutrophils to the endothelium  The recruitment of neutrophils from the peripheral circulation to sites of tissue injury and infection involves the distinct stages of margination, rolling, adhesion, extravasation, and chemotaxis/migration.
