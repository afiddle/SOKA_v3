# Question
Severe sickle cell anemia (homozygous for HbS) occurs due to a point mutation at the 6th amino acid position of the beta globin chain that substitutes **glutamic acid::hydrophilic** with **valine::hydrophobic**

# Answer
Glutamic acid (HbA) is negatively charged while valine (HbS) is neutral. HbS contains valine in place of glutamic acid at the 6th amino acid position of the beta globin chain  HbS allows / promotes hydrophobic interaction among Hb molecules == HbS polymerization and RBC sickling == severe anemia complicated by vasoocclusive pain episodes
