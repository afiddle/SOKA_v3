# Question
Atherosclerosis begins with endothelial cell dysfunction which allows **lipids** to leak into the intima

---

# Answer
First step = endothelial cell injury and dysfunction 2. monolymphocytic migration *intima* = LDL degradation 3. platelet adhesion ~ subendothelial collagen exposure 4. medial SMC smooth mm cell migration == fibrous cap of fibrofatty atheroma 5. macrophages phagocyte LDL cholesterol == fatty streak (ie, lipid-laden foam cells) == necrosis of foam cells = cycle of injury
