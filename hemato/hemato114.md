# Question
The t(9;22) translocation (BCR-ABL) is also known as the **Philadelphia** chromosome most commonly seen in CML and rarely in ALL

# Answer
BCR-ABL = the resulting fusion gene of t(9;22) encodes a protein with inc tyrosine kinase activity that inhibits apoptosis while promoting mitogenesis  The pathophysiology of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)   In CML, translocation between c(9; 22).   - The ABL proto-oncogene is transported from c9 to c22 where it is placed adjacent to the BCR gene.   - The resulting oncogene, BCR-ABL, codes for a fusion protein with constitutively active tyrosine kinase activity.   - This protein stimulates the proliferation of granulocytic precursors == development of CML.   - The kinase activity of this fusion protein is a target of the protein kinase inhibitor, imatinib.
