# Question
What underlying pathology is associated with hyperplastic arteriolosclerosis?    **severe (malignant) hypertension**

---

# Answer
atherosclerosis of the renal arteriolar walls == activation of RAAS, which further worsens the hypertension  malignant nephrosclerosis = fibrinoid necrosis of small arteriolar walls & hyperplastic arteriolosclerosis  narrowing and/or obliteration of the arteriolar lumen == RBCs fragmentation 'n' PLT consumption == MAHA microangiopathic hemolytic anemia  Labs reflect renal injury (eg, inc Cr(s) and BUN) and hemolytic anemia (eg, schistocytes [fragmented RBCs] on peripheral smear, elevated LDH and indirect bilirubin).
