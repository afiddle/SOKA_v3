# Question
Patients homozygous for HbC have **milder::severity** disease than those homozygous for HbS aka HbSS patients

# Answer
i.e. combination of HbC disease and sickle cell trait is milder than sickle cell disease;   HbS allows / promotes hydrophobic interaction among Hb molecules == HbS polymerization and RBC sickling (=damage 'n' permanent distortion) == severe anemia complicated by vasoocclusive pain episodes  HbS contains valine in place of glutamic acid at the 6th amino acid position of the beta globin chain
