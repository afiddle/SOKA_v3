# Question
DNA **methylation** at **CpG** islands **silences** transcription

---

# Answer
Methylation of the CpG region adjacent to the MGMT gene, which produces an enzyme that repairs damaged DNA, makes tumor cells much more susceptible to alkylating chemotherapy (eg, temozolomide), since alkylating agents == DNA damage that cannot be effectively repaired w/o MGMT
