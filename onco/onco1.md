# Question
Pituitary adenoma may present with **bitemporal hemianopsia** due to compression of the **optic chiasm**

---

# Answer
optic nerve fibers decussate at the optic chiasm, which is located immediately superior to the pituitary gland   Mass lesions compress the optic chiasm == visual field deficit = bitemporal hemianopsia    Tumor sits in sella turcica, which is adjacent to optic chiasm
