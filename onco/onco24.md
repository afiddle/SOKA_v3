# Question
What type of primer is used in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)?   **DNA primer**

# Answer
in the body, RNA primers are used; in the test tube = DNA primers are   Several elements are required. The first is a source DNA template that includes the target region to be amplified (eg, BRCA1 exon 11) as well as flanking sequences adjacent to the target region.  The oligonucleotide sequence of these flanking regions must be known in order to make the primers necessary to start PCR.    A thermostable DNA polymerase is then used to replicate the DNA template from a pool of supplied deoxynucleotide triphosphates using 3 steps:  1. Denaturing: thermal separation of the DNA template  2. Annealing: Primers combine with the denatured, single stranded flanking ends of the target region when the temperature is lowered.  3. Elongation: DNA polymerase forms new daughter DNA strands in the 5' to 3' direction = daughter synthesizes multiple, short DNA fragments
