# Question
Advanced invasive ductal carcinoma tumors may result in dimpling of skin or **retraction** of the nipple

# Answer
Overlying skin retractions (puckering) = involvement of suspensory ligaments of the breast (ie, Cooper ligaments).  Malignant infiltration of these == fibrosis and shortening == traction on the skin with distortion in breast contour.
