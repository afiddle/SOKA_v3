# Answer
S-100 = positive in >95% of melanomas = a protein expressed in cells derived from the neural crest such as melanocytes, and   HMB-45 = highly sensitive (>95%) & specific (~100%) for malignancy = a marker for immature melanosomes found in melanocytic TU  ddx = Paget disease of the breast, an adenoCA of the areolar epithelium
