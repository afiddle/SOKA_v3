# Question
Prostate cancer is an **androgen**-sensitive tumor. **Orchiectomy::Surgery** eliminates their primary **testicular::site of** production.   However, adrenal glands and tumor cells produce them too via **17-alpha-hydroxylase::enzyme** expression. Thus, advanced or **castration**-resistant disease are often treated with **17-alpha-hydroxylase inhibitors::eg, abiraterone**

# Answer
17-alpha-hydroxylase = enzyme that normally converts pregnenolone/progesterone into DHEA 17-alpha-hydroxylase inhibitors (eg, abiraterone) == slows growth of the advanced tumor
