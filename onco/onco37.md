# Question

# Answer
pituitary adenoma begins as superior quadrantanopia; craniopharyngioma begins as inferior quadrantanopia     optic nerve fibers decussate at the optic chiasm, which is located immediately superior to the pituitary gland   Mass lesions compress the optic chiasm == visual field deficit = bitemporal hemianopsia    Tumor sits in sella turcica, which is adjacent to optic chiasm
