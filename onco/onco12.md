# Answer
may lead to hydronephrosis and renal failure, which is a common cause of death in cervical carcinoma patients   Ureteral obstruction 'n' vesicoureteral reflux are common urinary tract complications. - Chronic reflux == hydroureter and hydronephrosis = dilation of the renal pelvis and calyces == compression atrophy of the renal parenchyma and eventual renal insufficiency and failure - Hydronephrosis can be graded in severity; most severe = compress the parenchyma == gross distortion of renal architecture.
